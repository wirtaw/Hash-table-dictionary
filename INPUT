THE
PLATTNER
STORY
Whether
the
story
of
Gottfried
Plattner
is
to
be
credited
or
not
is
a
pretty
question
in
the
value
of
evidence
On
the
one
hand
we
have
seven
witnessesto
be
perfectly
exact
we
have
six
and
a
half
pairs
of
eyes
and
one
undeniable
fact
and
on
the
other
we
havewhat
is
itprejudice
common
sense
the
inertia
of
opinion
Never
were
there
seven
more
honestseeming
witnesses
never
was
there
a
more
undeniable
fact
than
the
inversion
of
Gottfried
Plattners
anatomical
structure
andnever
was
there
a
more
preposterous
story
than
the
one
they
have
to
tell!
The
most
preposterous
part
of
the
story
is
the
worthy
Gottfrieds
contribution
for
I
count
him
as
one
of
the
seven
Heaven
forbid
that
I
should
be
led
into
giving
countenance
to
superstition
by
a
passion
for
impartiality
and
so
come
to
share
the
fate
of
Eusapias
patrons!
Frankly
I
believe
there
is
something
crooked
about
this
business
of
Gottfried
Plattner
but
what
that
crooked
factor
is
I
will
admit
as
frankly
I
do
not
know
I
have
been
surprised
at
the
credit
accorded
to
the
story
in
the
most
unexpected
and
authoritative
quarters
The
fairest
way
to
the
reader
however
will
be
for
me
to
tell
it
without
further
comment
Gottfried
Plattner
is
in
spite
of
his
name
a
freeborn
Englishman
His
father
was
an
Alsatian
who
came
to
England
in
the
Sixties
married
a
respectable
English
girl
of
unexceptionable
antecedents
and
died
after
a
wholesome
and
uneventful
life
devoted
I
understand
chiefly
to
the
laying
of
parquet
flooring
in

Gottfrieds
age
is
sevenandtwenty
He
is
by
virtue
of
his
heritage
of
three
languages
Modern
Languages
Master
in
a
small
private
school
in
the
South
of
England
To
the
casual
observer
he
is
singularly
like
any
other
Modern
Languages
Master
in
any
other
small
private
school
His
costume
is
neither
very
costly
nor
very
fashionable
but
on
the
other
hand
it
is
not
markedly
cheap
or
shabby
his
complexion
like
his
height
and
his
bearing
is
inconspicuous
You
would
notice
perhaps
that
like
the
majority
of
people
his
face
was
not
absolutely
symmetrical
his
right
eye
a
little
larger
than
the
left
and
his
jaw
a
trifle
heavier
on
the
right
side
If
you
as
an
ordinary
careless
person
were
to
bare
his
chest
and
feel
his
heart
beating
you
would
probably
find
it
quite
like
the
heart
of
anyone
else
But
here
you
and
the
trained
observer
would
part
company
If
you
found
his
heart
quite
ordinary
the
trained
observer
would
find
it
quite
otherwise
And
once
the
thing
was
pointed
out
to
you
you
too
would
perceive
the
peculiarity
easily
enough
It
is
that
Gottfrieds
heart
beats
on
the
right
side
of
his
body
Now
that
is
not
the
only
singularity
of
Gottfrieds
structure
although
it
is
the
only
one
that
would
appeal
to
the
untrained
mind
Careful
sounding
of
Gottfrieds
internal
arrangements
by
a
wellknown
surgeon
seems
to
point
to
the
fact
that
all
the
other
unsymmetrical
parts
of
his
body
are
similarly
misplaced
The
right
lobe
of
his
liver
is
on
the
left
side
the
left
on
his
right
while
his
lungs
too
are
similarly
contraposed
What
is
still
more
singular
unless
Gottfried
is
a
consummate
actor
we
must
believe
that
his
right
hand
has
recently
become
his
left
Since
the
occurrences
we
are
about
to
consider
as
impartially
as
possible
he
has
found
the
utmost
difficulty
in
writing
except
from
right
to
left
across
the
paper
with
his
left
hand
He
cannot
throw
with
his
right
hand
he
is
perplexed
at
meal
times
between
knife
and
fork
and
his
ideas
of
the
rule
of
the
roadhe
is
a
cyclistare
still
a
dangerous
confusion
And
there
is
not
a
scrap
of
evidence
to
show
that
before
these
occurrences
Gottfried
was
at
all
lefthanded
There
is
yet
another
wonderful
fact
in
this
preposterous
business
Gottfried
produces
three
photographs
of
himself
You
have
him
at
the
age
of
five
or
six
thrusting
fat
legs
at
you
from
under
a
plaid
frock
and
scowling
In
that
photograph
his
left
eye
is
a
little
larger
than
his
right
and
his
jaw
is
a
trifle
heavier
on
the
left
side
This
is
the
reverse
of
his
present
living
conditions
The
photograph
of
Gottfried
at
fourteen
seems
to
contradict
these
facts
but
that
is
because
it
is
one
of
those
cheap
Gem
photographs
that
were
then
in
vogue
taken
direct
upon
metal
and
therefore
reversing
things
just
as
a
lookingglass
would
The
third
photograph
represents
him
at
oneandtwenty
and
confirms
the
record
of
the
others
There
seems
here
evidence
of
the
strongest
confirmatory
character
that
Gottfried
has
exchanged
his
left
side
for
his
right
Yet
how
a
human
being
can
be
so
changed
short
of
a
fantastic
and
pointless
miracle
it
is
exceedingly
hard
to
suggest
In
one
way
of
course
these
facts
might
be
explicable
on
the
supposition
that
Plattner
has
undertaken
an
elaborate
mystification
on
the
strength
of
his
hearts
displacement
Photographs
may
be
fudged
and
lefthandedness
imitated
But
the
character
of
the
man
does
not
lend
itself
to
any
such
theory
He
is
quiet
practical
unobtrusive
and
thoroughly
sane
from
the
Nordau
standpoint
He
likes
beer
and
smokes
moderately
takes
walking
exercise
daily
and
has
a
healthily
high
estimate
of
the
value
of
his
teaching
He
has
a
good
but
untrained
tenor
voice
and
takes
a
pleasure
in
singing
airs
of
a
popular
and
cheerful
character
He
is
fond
but
not
morbidly
fond
of
readingchiefly
fiction
pervaded
with
a
vaguely
pious
optimismsleeps
well
and
rarely
dreams
He
is
in
fact
the
very
last
person
to
evolve
a
fantastic
fable
Indeed
so
far
from
forcing
this
story
upon
the
world
he
has
been
singularly
reticent
on
the
matter
He
meets
inquirers
with
a
certain
engagingbashfulness
is
almost
the
word
that
disarms
the
most
suspicious
He
seems
genuinely
ashamed
that
anything
so
unusual
has
occurred
to
him
It
is
to
be
regretted
that
Plattners
aversion
to
the
idea
of
postmortem
dissection
may
postpone
perhaps
for
ever
the
positive
proof
that
his
entire
body
has
had
its
left
and
right
sides
transposed
Upon
that
fact
mainly
the
credibility
of
his
story
hangs
There
is
no
way
of
taking
a
man
and
moving
him
about
in
space
as
ordinary
people
understand
space
that
will
result
in
our
changing
his
sides
Whatever
you
do
his
right
is
still
his
right
his
left
his
left
You
can
do
that
with
a
perfectly
thin
and
flat
thing
of
course
If
you
were
to
cut
a
figure
out
of
paper
any
figure
with
a
right
and
left
side
you
could
change
its
sides
simply
by
lifting
it
up
and
turning
it
over
But
with
a
solid
it
is
different
Mathematical
theorists
tell
us
that
the
only
way
in
which
the
right
and
left
sides
of
a
solid
body
can
be
changed
is
by
taking
that
body
clean
out
of
space
as
we
know
ittaking
it
out
of
ordinary
existence
that
is
and
turning
it
somewhere
outside
space
This
is
a
little
abstruse
no
doubt
but
anyone
with
any
knowledge
of
mathematical
theory
will
assure
the
reader
of
its
truth
To
put
the
thing
in
technical
language
the
curious
inversion
of
Plattners
right
and
left
sides
is
proof
that
he
has
moved
out
of
our
space
into
what
is
called
the
Fourth
Dimension
and
that
he
has
returned
again
to
our
world
Unless
we
choose
to
consider
ourselves
the
victims
of
an
elaborate
and
motiveless
fabrication
we
are
almost
bound
to
believe
that
this
has
occurred
So
much
for
the
tangible
facts
We
come
now
to
the
account
of
the
phenomena
that
attended
his
temporary
disappearance
from
the
world
It
appears
that
in
the
Sussexville
Proprietary
School
Plattner
not
only
discharged
the
duties
of
Modern
Languages
Master
but
also
taught
chemistry
commercial
geography
bookkeeping
shorthand
drawing
and
any
other
additional
subject
to
which
the
changing
fancies
of
the
boys
parents
might
direct
attention
He
knew
little
or
nothing
of
these
various
subjects
but
in
secondary
as
distinguished
from
Board
or
elementary
schools
knowledge
in
the
teacher
is
very
properly
by
no
means
so
necessary
as
high
moral
character
and
gentlemanly
tone
In
chemistry
he
was
particularly
deficient
knowing
he
says
nothing
beyond
the
Three
Gases
whatever
the
three
gases
may
be
As
however
his
pupils
began
by
knowing
nothing
and
derived
all
their
information
from
him
this
caused
him
or
anyone
but
little
inconvenience
for
several
terms
Then
a
little
boy
named
Whibble
joined
the
school
who
had
been
educated
it
seems
by
some
mischievous
relative
into
an
inquiring
habit
of
mind
This
little
boy
followed
Plattners
lessons
with
marked
and
sustained
interest
and
in
order
to
exhibit
his
zeal
on
the
subject
brought
at
various
times
substances
for
Plattner
to
analyse
Plattner
flattered
by
this
evidence
of
his
power
of
awakening
interest
and
trusting
to
the
boys
ignorance
analysed
these
and
even
made
general
statements
as
to
their
composition
Indeed
he
was
so
far
stimulated
by
his
pupil
as
to
obtain
a
work
upon
analytical
chemistry
and
study
it
during
his
supervision
of
the
evenings
preparation
He
was
surprised
to
find
chemistry
quite
an
interesting
subject
So
far
the
story
is
absolutely
commonplace
But
now
the
greenish
powder
comes
upon
the
scene
The
source
of
that
greenish
powder
seems
unfortunately
lost
Master
Whibble
tells
a
tortuous
story
of
finding
it
done
up
in
a
packet
in
a
disused
limekiln
near
the
Downs
It
would
have
been
an
excellent
thing
for
Plattner
and
possibly
for
Master
Whibbles
family
if
a
match
could
have
been
applied
to
that
powder
there
and
then
The
young
gentleman
certainly
did
not
bring
it
to
school
in
a
packet
but
in
a
common
eightounce
graduated
medicine
bottle
plugged
with
masticated
newspaper
He
gave
it
to
Plattner
at
the
end
of
the
afternoon
school
Four
boys
had
been
detained
after
school
prayers
in
order
to
complete
some
neglected
tasks
and
Plattner
was
supervising
these
in
the
small
classroom
in
which
the
chemical
teaching
was
conducted
The
appliances
for
the
practical
teaching
of
chemistry
in
the
Sussexville
Proprietary
School
as
in
most
small
schools
in
this
country
are
characterised
by
a
severe
simplicity
They
are
kept
in
a
small
cupboard
standing
in
a
recess
and
having
about
the
same
capacity
as
a
common
travelling
trunk
Plattner
being
bored
with
his
passive
superintendence
seems
to
have
welcomed
the
intervention
of
Whibble
with
his
green
powder
as
an
agreeable
diversion
and
unlocking
this
cupboard
proceeded
at
once
with
his
analytical
experiments
Whibble
sat
luckily
for
himself
at
a
safe
distance
regarding
him
The
four
malefactors
feigning
a
profound
absorption
in
their
work
watched
him
furtively
with
the
keenest
interest
For
even
within
the
limits
of
the
Three
Gases
Plattners
practical
chemistry
was
I
understand
temerarious
They
are
practically
unanimous
in
their
account
of
Plattners
proceedings
He
poured
a
little
of
the
green
powder
into
a
testtube
and
tried
the
substance
with
water
hydrochloric
acid
nitric
acid
and
sulphuric
acid
in
succession
Getting
no
result
he
emptied
out
a
little
heapnearly
half
the
bottleful
in
factupon
a
slate
and
tried
a
match
He
held
the
medicine
bottle
in
his
left
hand
The
stuff
began
to
smoke
and
melt
and
thenexploded
with
deafening
violence
and
a
blinding
flash
The
five
boys
seeing
the
flash
and
being
prepared
for
catastrophes
ducked
below
their
desks
and
were
none
of
them
seriously
hurt
The
window
was
blown
out
into
the
playground
and
the
blackboard
on
its
easel
was
upset
The
slate
was
smashed
to
atoms
Some
plaster
fell
from
the
ceiling
No
other
damage
was
done
to
the
school
edifice
or
appliances
and
the
boys
at
first
seeing
nothing
of
Plattner
fancied
he
was
knocked
down
and
lying
out
of
their
sight
below
the
desks
They
jumped
out
of
their
places
to
go
to
his
assistance
and
were
amazed
to
find
the
space
empty
Being
still
confused
by
the
sudden
violence
of
the
report
they
hurried
to
the
open
door
under
the
impression
that
he
must
have
been
hurt
and
have
rushed
out
of
the
room
But
Carson
the
foremost
nearly
collided
in
the
doorway
with
the
principal
Mr
Lidgett
Mr
Lidgett
is
a
corpulent
excitable
man
with
one
eye
The
boys
describe
him
as
stumbling
into
the
room
mouthing
some
of
those
tempered
expletives
irritable
schoolmasters
accustom
themselves
to
uselest
worse
befall
Wretched
mumchancer!
he
said
Wheres
Mr
Plattner
The
boys
are
agreed
on
the
very
words
Wobbler
snivelling
puppy
and
mumchancer
are
it
seems
among
the
ordinary
small
change
of
Mr
Lidgetts
scholastic
commerce
Wheres
Mr
Plattner
That
was
a
question
that
was
to
be
repeated
many
times
in
the
next
few
days
It
really
seemed
as
though
that
frantic
hyperbole
blown
to
atoms
had
for
once
realised
itself
There
was
not
a
visible
particle
of
Plattner
to
be
seen
not
a
drop
of
blood
nor
a
stitch
of
clothing
to
be
found
Apparently
he
had
been
blown
clean
out
of
existence
and
left
not
a
wrack
behind
Not
so
much
as
would
cover
a
sixpenny
piece
to
quote
a
proverbial
expression!
The
evidence
of
his
absolute
disappearance
as
a
consequence
of
that
explosion
is
indubitable
It
is
not
necessary
to
enlarge
here
upon
the
commotion
excited
in
the
Sussexville
Proprietary
School
and
in
Sussexville
and
elsewhere
by
this
event
It
is
quite
possible
indeed
that
some
of
the
readers
of
these
pages
may
recall
the
hearing
of
some
remote
and
dying
version
of
that
excitement
during
the
last
summer
holidays
Lidgett
it
would
seem
did
everything
in
his
power
to
suppress
and
minimise
the
story
He
instituted
a
penalty
of
twentyfive
lines
for
any
mention
of
Plattners
name
among
the
boys
and
stated
in
the
schoolroom
that
he
was
clearly
aware
of
his
assistants
whereabouts
He
was
afraid
he
explains
that
the
possibility
of
an
explosion
happening
in
spite
of
the
elaborate
precautions
taken
to
minimise
the
practical
teaching
of
chemistry
might
injure
the
reputation
of
the
school
and
so
might
any
mysterious
quality
in
Plattners
departure
Indeed
he
did
everything
in
his
power
to
make
the
occurrence
seem
as
ordinary
as
possible
In
particular
he
crossexamined
the
five
eyewitnesses
of
the
occurrence
so
searchingly
that
they
began
to
doubt
the
plain
evidence
of
their
senses
But
in
spite
of
these
efforts
the
tale
in
a
magnified
and
distorted
state
made
a
nine
days
wonder
in
the
district
and
several
parents
withdrew
their
sons
on
colourable
pretexts
Not
the
least
remarkable
point
in
the
matter
is
the
fact
that
a
large
number
of
people
in
the
neighbourhood
dreamed
singularly
vivid
dreams
of
Plattner
during
the
period
of
excitement
before
his
return
and
that
these
dreams
had
a
curious
uniformity
In
almost
all
of
them
Plattner
was
seen
sometimes
singly
sometimes
in
company
wandering
about
through
a
coruscating
iridescence
In
all
cases
his
face
was
pale
and
distressed
and
in
some
he
gesticulated
towards
the
dreamer
One
or
two
of
the
boys
evidently
under
the
influence
of
nightmare
fancied
that
Plattner
approached
them
with
remarkable
swiftness
and
seemed
to
look
closely
into
their
very
eyes
Others
fled
with
Plattner
from
the
pursuit
of
vague
and
extraordinary
creatures
of
a
globular
shape
But
all
these
fancies
were
forgotten
in
inquiries
and
speculations
when
on
the
Wednesday
next
but
one
after
the
Monday
of
the
explosion
Plattner
returned
The
circumstances
of
his
return
were
as
singular
as
those
of
his
departure
So
far
as
Mr
Lidgetts
somewhat
choleric
outline
can
be
filled
in
from
Plattners
hesitating
statements
it
would
appear
that
on
Wednesday
evening
towards
the
hour
of
sunset
the
former
gentleman
having
dismissed
evening
preparation
was
engaged
in
his
garden
picking
and
eating
strawberries
a
fruit
of
which
he
is
inordinately
fond
It
is
a
large
oldfashioned
garden
secured
from
observation
fortunately
by
a
high
and
ivycovered
redbrick
wall
Just
as
he
was
stooping
over
a
particularly
prolific
plant
there
was
a
flash
in
the
air
and
a
heavy
thud
and
before
he
could
look
round
some
heavy
body
struck
him
violently
from
behind
He
was
pitched
forward
crushing
the
strawberries
he
held
in
his
hand
and
that
so
roughly
that
his
silk
hatMr
Lidgett
adheres
to
the
older
ideas
of
scholastic
costumewas
driven
violently
down
upon
his
forehead
and
almost
over
one
eye
This
heavy
missile
which
slid
over
him
sideways
and
collapsed
into
a
sitting
posture
among
the
strawberry
plants
proved
to
be
our
longlost
Mr
Gottfried
Plattner
in
an
extremely
dishevelled
condition
He
was
collarless
and
hatless
his
linen
was
dirty
and
there
was
blood
upon
his
hands
Mr
Lidgett
was
so
indignant
and
surprised
that
he
remained
on
allfours
and
with
his
hat
jammed
down
on
his
eye
while
he
expostulated
vehemently
with
Plattner
for
his
disrespectful
and
unaccountable
conduct
This
scarcely
idyllic
scene
completes
what
I
may
call
the
exterior
version
of
the
Plattner
storyits
exoteric
aspect
It
is
quite
unnecessary
to
enter
here
into
all
the
details
of
his
dismissal
by
Mr
Lidgett
Such
details
with
the
full
names
and
dates
and
references
will
be
found
in
the
larger
report
of
these
occurrences
that
was
laid
before
the
Society
for
the
Investigation
of
Abnormal
Phenomena
The
singular
transposition
of
Plattners
right
and
left
sides
was
scarcely
observed
for
the
first
day
or
so
and
then
first
in
connection
with
his
disposition
to
write
from
right
to
left
across
the
blackboard
He
concealed
rather
than
ostended
this
curious
confirmatory
circumstance
as
he
considered
it
would
unfavourably
affect
his
prospects
in
a
new
situation
The
displacement
of
his
heart
was
discovered
some
months
after
when
he
was
having
a
tooth
extracted
under
an
sthetics
He
then
very
unwillingly
allowed
a
cursory
surgical
examination
to
be
made
of
himself
with
a
view
to
a
brief
account
in
the
Journal
of
Anatomy
That
exhausts
the
statement
of
the
material
facts
and
we
may
now
go
on
to
consider
Plattners
account
of
the
matter
But
first
let
us
clearly
differentiate
between
the
preceding
portion
of
this
story
and
what
is
to
follow
All
I
have
told
thus
far
is
established
by
such
evidence
as
even
a
criminal
lawyer
would
approve
Every
one
of
the
witnesses
is
still
alive
the
reader
if
he
have
the
leisure
may
hunt
the
lads
out
tomorrow
or
even
brave
the
terrors
of
the
redoubtable
Lidgett
and
crossexamine
and
trap
and
test
to
his
hearts
content
Gottfried
Plattner
himself
and
his
twisted
heart
and
his
three
photographs
are
producible
It
may
be
taken
as
proved
that
he
did
disappear
for
nine
days
as
the
consequence
of
an
explosion
that
he
returned
almost
as
violently
under
circumstances
in
their
nature
annoying
to
Mr
Lidgett
whatever
the
details
of
those
circumstances
may
be
and
that
he
returned
inverted
just
as
a
reflection
returns
from
a
mirror
From
the
last
fact
as
I
have
already
stated
it
follows
almost
inevitably
that
Plattner
during
those
nine
days
must
have
been
in
some
state
of
existence
altogether
out
of
space
The
evidence
to
these
statements
is
indeed
far
stronger
than
that
upon
which
most
murderers
are
hanged
But
for
his
own
particular
account
of
where
he
had
been
with
its
confused
explanations
and
wellnigh
selfcontradictory
details
we
have
only
Mr
Gottfried
Plattners
word
I
do
not
wish
to
discredit
that
but
I
must
point
outwhat
so
many
writers
upon
obscure
psychic
phenomena
fail
to
dothat
we
are
passing
here
from
the
practically
undeniable
to
that
kind
of
matter
which
any
reasonable
man
is
entitled
to
believe
or
reject
as
he
thinks
proper
The
previous
statements
render
it
plausible
its
discordance
with
common
experience
tilts
it
towards
the
incredible
I
would
prefer
not
to
sway
the
beam
of
the
readers
judgment
either
way
but
simply
to
tell
the
story
as
Plattner
told
it
me
He
gave
me
his
narrative
I
may
state
at
my
house
at
Chislehurst
and
so
soon
as
he
had
left
me
that
evening
I
went
into
my
study
and
wrote
down
everything
as
I
remembered
it
Subsequently
he
was
good
enough
to
read
over
a
typewritten
copy
so
that
its
substantial
correctness
is
undeniable
He
states
that
at
the
moment
of
the
explosion
he
distinctly
thought
he
was
killed
He
felt
lifted
off
his
feet
and
driven
forcibly
backward
It
is
a
curious
fact
for
psychologists
that
he
thought
clearly
during
his
backward
flight
and
wondered
whether
he
should
hit
the
chemistry
cupboard
or
the
blackboard
easel
His
heels
struck
ground
and
he
staggered
and
fell
heavily
into
a
sitting
position
on
something
soft
and
firm
For
a
moment
the
concussion
stunned
him
He
became
aware
at
once
of
a
vivid
scent
of
singed
hair
and
he
seemed
to
hear
the
voice
of
Lidgett
asking
for
him
You
will
understand
that
for
a
time
his
mind
was
greatly
confused
At
first
he
was
distinctly
under
the
impression
that
he
was
still
in
the
classroom
He
perceived
quite
distinctly
the
surprise
of
the
boys
and
the
entry
of
Mr
Lidgett
He
is
quite
positive
upon
that
score
He
did
not
hear
their
remarks
but
that
he
ascribed
to
the
deafening
effect
of
the
experiment
Things
about
him
seemed
curiously
dark
and
faint
but
his
mind
explained
that
on
the
obvious
but
mistaken
idea
that
the
explosion
had
engendered
a
huge
volume
of
dark
smoke
Through
the
dimness
the
figures
of
Lidgett
and
the
boys
moved
as
faint
and
silent
as
ghosts
Plattners
face
still
tingled
with
the
stinging
heat
of
the
flash
He
was
he
says
all
muddled
His
first
definite
thoughts
seem
to
have
been
of
his
personal
safety
He
thought
he
was
perhaps
blinded
and
deafened
He
felt
his
limbs
and
face
in
a
gingerly
manner
Then
his
perceptions
grew
clearer
and
he
was
astonished
to
miss
the
old
familiar
desks
and
other
schoolroom
furniture
about
him
Only
dim
uncertain
grey
shapes
stood
in
the
place
of
these
Then
came
a
thing
that
made
him
shout
aloud
and
awoke
his
stunned
faculties
to
instant
activity
Two
of
the
boys
gesticulating
walked
one
after
the
other
clean
through
him!
Neither
manifested
the
slightest
consciousness
of
his
presence
It
is
difficult
to
imagine
the
sensation
he
felt
They
came
against
him
he
says
with
no
more
force
than
a
wisp
of
mist
Plattners
first
thought
after
that
was
that
he
was
dead
Having
been
brought
up
with
thoroughly
sound
views
in
these
matters
however
he
was
a
little
surprised
to
find
his
body
still
about
him
His
second
conclusion
was
that
he
was
not
dead
but
that
the
others
were
that
the
explosion
had
destroyed
the
Sussexville
Proprietary
School
and
every
soul
in
it
except
himself
But
that
too
was
scarcely
satisfactory
He
was
thrown
back
upon
astonished
observation
Everything
about
him
was
extraordinarily
dark
at
first
it
seemed
to
have
an
altogether
ebony
blackness
Overhead
was
a
black
firmament
The
only
touch
of
light
in
the
scene
was
a
faint
greenish
glow
at
the
edge
of
the
sky
in
one
direction
which
threw
into
prominence
a
horizon
of
undulating
black
hills
This
I
say
was
his
impression
at
first
As
his
eye
grew
accustomed
to
the
darkness
he
began
to
distinguish
a
faint
quality
of
differentiating
greenish
colour
in
the
circumambient
night
Against
this
background
the
furniture
and
occupants
of
the
classroom
it
seems
stood
out
like
phosphorescent
spectres
faint
and
impalpable
He
extended
his
hand
and
thrust
it
without
an
effort
through
the
wall
of
the
room
by
the
fireplace
He
describes
himself
as
making
a
strenuous
effort
to
attract
attention
He
shouted
to
Lidgett
and
tried
to
seize
the
boys
as
they
went
to
and
fro
He
only
desisted
from
these
attempts
when
Mrs
Lidgett
whom
he
as
an
Assistant
Master
naturally
disliked
entered
the
room
He
says
the
sensation
of
being
in
the
world
and
yet
not
a
part
of
it
was
an
extraordinarily
disagreeable
one
He
compared
his
feelings
not
inaptly
to
those
of
a
cat
watching
a
mouse
through
a
window
Whenever
he
made
a
motion
to
communicate
with
the
dim
familiar
world
about
him
he
found
an
invisible
incomprehensible
barrier
preventing
intercourse
He
then
turned
his
attention
to
his
solid
environment
He
found
the
medicine
bottle
still
unbroken
in
his
hand
with
the
remainder
of
the
green
powder
therein
He
put
this
in
his
pocket
and
began
to
feel
about
him
Apparently
he
was
sitting
on
a
boulder
of
rock
covered
with
a
velvety
moss
The
dark
country
about
him
he
was
unable
to
see
the
faint
misty
picture
of
the
schoolroom
blotting
it
out
but
he
had
a
feeling
due
perhaps
to
a
cold
wind
that
he
was
near
the
crest
of
a
hill
and
that
a
steep
valley
fell
away
beneath
his
feet
The
green
glow
along
the
edge
of
the
sky
seemed
to
be
growing
in
extent
and
intensity
He
stood
up
rubbing
his
eyes
It
would
seem
that
he
made
a
few
steps
going
steeply
down
hill
and
then
stumbled
nearly
fell
and
sat
down
again
upon
a
jagged
mass
of
rock
to
watch
the
dawn
He
became
aware
that
the
world
about
him
was
absolutely
silent
It
was
as
still
as
it
was
dark
and
though
there
was
a
cold
wind
blowing
up
the
hillface
the
rustle
of
grass
the
soughing
of
the
boughs
that
should
have
accompanied
it
were
absent
He
could
hear
therefore
if
he
could
not
see
that
the
hillside
upon
which
he
stood
was
rocky
and
desolate
The
green
grew
brighter
every
moment
and
as
it
did
so
a
faint
transparent
bloodred
mingled
with
but
did
not
mitigate
the
blackness
of
the
sky
overhead
and
the
rocky
desolations
about
him
Having
regard
to
what
follows
I
am
inclined
to
think
that
that
redness
may
have
been
an
optical
effect
due
to
contrast
Something
black
fluttered
momentarily
against
the
livid
yellowgreen
of
the
lower
sky
and
then
the
thin
and
penetrating
voice
of
a
bell
rose
out
of
the
black
gulf
below
him
An
oppressive
expectation
grew
with
the
growing
light
It
is
probable
that
an
hour
or
more
elapsed
while
he
sat
there
the
strange
green
light
growing
brighter
every
moment
and
spreading
slowly
in
flamboyant
fingers
upward
towards
the
zenith
As
it
grew
the
spectral
vision
of
our
world
became
relatively
or
absolutely
fainter
Probably
both
for
the
time
must
have
been
about
that
of
our
earthly
sunset
So
far
as
his
vision
of
our
world
went
Plattner
by
his
few
steps
downhill
had
passed
through
the
floor
of
the
classroom
and
was
now
it
seemed
sitting
in
midair
in
the
larger
schoolroom
downstairs
He
saw
the
boarders
distinctly
but
much
more
faintly
than
he
had
seen
Lidgett
They
were
preparing
their
evening
tasks
and
he
noticed
with
interest
that
several
were
cheating
with
their
Euclid
riders
by
means
of
a
crib
a
compilation
whose
existence
he
had
hitherto
never
suspected
As
the
time
passed
they
faded
steadily
as
steadily
as
the
light
of
the
green
dawn
increased
Looking
down
into
the
valley
he
saw
that
the
light
had
crept
far
down
its
rocky
sides
and
that
the
profound
blackness
of
the
abyss
was
now
broken
by
a
minute
green
glow
like
the
light
of
a
glowworm
And
almost
immediately
the
limb
of
a
huge
heavenly
body
of
blazing
green
rose
over
the
basaltic
undulations
of
the
distant
hills
and
the
monstrous
hillmasses
about
him
came
out
gaunt
and
desolate
in
green
light
and
deep
ruddy
black
shadows
He
became
aware
of
a
vast
number
of
ballshaped
objects
drifting
as
thistledown
drifts
over
the
high
ground
There
were
none
of
these
nearer
to
him
than
the
opposite
side
of
the
gorge
The
bell
below
twanged
quicker
and
quicker
with
something
like
impatient
insistence
and
several
lights
moved
hither
and
thither
The
boys
at
work
at
their
desks
were
now
almost
imperceptibly
faint
This
extinction
of
our
world
when
the
green
sun
of
this
other
universe
rose
is
a
curious
point
upon
which
Plattner
insists
During
the
OtherWorld
night
it
is
difficult
to
move
about
on
account
of
the
vividness
with
which
the
things
of
this
world
are
visible
It
becomes
a
riddle
to
explain
why
if
this
is
the
case
we
in
this
world
catch
no
glimpse
of
the
OtherWorld
It
is
due
perhaps
to
the
comparatively
vivid
illumination
of
this
world
of
ours
Plattner
describes
the
midday
of
the
OtherWorld
at
its
brightest
as
not
being
nearly
so
bright
as
this
world
at
full
moon
while
its
night
is
profoundly
black
Consequently
the
amount
of
light
even
in
an
ordinary
dark
room
is
sufficient
to
render
the
things
of
the
OtherWorld
invisible
on
the
same
principle
that
faint
phosphorescence
is
only
visible
in
the
profoundest
darkness
I
have
tried
since
he
told
me
his
story
to
see
something
of
the
OtherWorld
by
sitting
for
a
long
space
in
a
photographers
dark
room
at
night
I
have
certainly
seen
indistinctly
the
form
of
greenish
slopes
and
rocks
but
only
I
must
admit
very
indistinctly
indeed
The
reader
may
possibly
be
more
successful
Plattner
tells
me
that
since
his
return
he
has
dreamt
and
seen
and
recognised
places
in
the
OtherWorld
but
this
is
probably
due
to
his
memory
of
these
scenes
It
seems
quite
possible
that
people
with
unusually
keen
eyesight
may
occasionally
catch
a
glimpse
of
this
strange
OtherWorld
about
us
However
this
is
a
digression
As
the
green
sun
rose
a
long
street
of
black
buildings
became
perceptible
though
only
darkly
and
indistinctly
in
the
gorge
and
after
some
hesitation
Plattner
began
to
clamber
down
the
precipitous
descent
towards
them
The
descent
was
long
and
exceedingly
tedious
being
so
not
only
by
the
extraordinary
steepness
but
also
by
reason
of
the
looseness
of
the
boulders
with
which
the
whole
face
of
the
hill
was
strewn
The
noise
of
his
descentnow
and
then
his
heels
struck
fire
from
the
rocksseemed
now
the
only
sound
in
the
universe
for
the
beating
of
the
bell
had
ceased
As
he
drew
nearer
he
perceived
that
the
various
edifices
had
a
singular
resemblance
to
tombs
and
mausoleums
and
monuments
saving
only
that
they
were
all
uniformly
black
instead
of
being
white
as
most
sepulchres
are
And
then
he
saw
crowding
out
of
the
largest
building
very
much
as
people
disperse
from
church
a
number
of
pallid
rounded
palegreen
figures
These
dispersed
in
several
directions
about
the
broad
street
of
the
place
some
going
through
side
alleys
and
reappearing
upon
the
steepness
of
the
hill
others
entering
some
of
the
small
black
buildings
which
lined
the
way
At
the
sight
of
these
things
drifting
up
towards
him
Plattner
stopped
staring
They
were
not
walking
they
were
indeed
limbless
and
they
had
the
appearance
of
human
heads
beneath
which
a
tadpolelike
body
swung
He
was
too
astonished
at
their
strangeness
too
full
indeed
of
strangeness
to
be
seriously
alarmed
by
them
They
drove
towards
him
in
front
of
the
chill
wind
that
was
blowing
uphill
much
as
soapbubbles
drive
before
a
draught
And
as
he
looked
at
the
nearest
of
those
approaching
he
saw
it
was
indeed
a
human
head
albeit
with
singularly
large
eyes
and
wearing
such
an
expression
of
distress
and
anguish
as
he
had
never
seen
before
upon
mortal
countenance
He
was
surprised
to
find
that
it
did
not
turn
to
regard
him
but
seemed
to
be
watching
and
following
some
unseen
moving
thing
For
a
moment
he
was
puzzled
and
then
it
occurred
to
him
that
this
creature
was
watching
with
its
enormous
eyes
something
that
was
happening
in
the
world
he
had
just
left
Nearer
it
came
and
nearer
and
he
was
too
astonished
to
cry
out
It
made
a
very
faint
fretting
sound
as
it
came
close
to
him
Then
it
struck
his
face
with
a
gentle
patits
touch
was
very
coldand
drove
past
him
and
upward
towards
the
crest
of
the
hill
An
extraordinary
conviction
flashed
across
Plattners
mind
that
this
head
had
a
strong
likeness
to
Lidgett
Then
he
turned
his
attention
to
the
other
heads
that
were
now
swarming
thickly
up
the
hillside
None
made
the
slightest
sign
of
recognition
One
or
two
indeed
came
close
to
his
head
and
almost
followed
the
example
of
the
first
but
he
dodged
convulsively
out
of
the
way
Upon
most
of
them
he
saw
the
same
expression
of
unavailing
regret
he
had
seen
upon
the
first
and
heard
the
same
faint
sounds
of
wretchedness
from
them
One
or
two
wept
and
one
rolling
swiftly
uphill
wore
an
expression
of
diabolical
rage
But
others
were
cold
and
several
had
a
look
of
gratified
interest
in
their
eyes
One
at
least
was
almost
in
an
ecstasy
of
happiness
Plattner
does
not
remember
that
he
recognised
any
more
likenesses
in
those
he
saw
at
this
time
For
several
hours
perhaps
Plattner
watched
these
strange
things
dispersing
themselves
over
the
hills
and
not
till
long
after
they
had
ceased
to
issue
from
the
clustering
black
buildings
in
the
gorge
did
he
resume
his
downward
climb
The
darkness
about
him
increased
so
much
that
he
had
a
difficulty
in
stepping
true
Overhead
the
sky
was
now
a
bright
pale
green
He
felt
neither
hunger
nor
thirst
Later
when
he
did
he
found
a
chilly
stream
running
down
the
centre
of
the
gorge
and
the
rare
moss
upon
the
boulders
when
he
tried
it
at
last
in
desperation
was
good
to
eat
He
groped
about
among
the
tombs
that
ran
down
the
gorge
seeking
vaguely
for
some
clue
to
these
inexplicable
things
After
a
long
time
he
came
to
the
entrance
of
the
big
mausoleumlike
building
from
which
the
heads
had
issued
In
this
he
found
a
group
of
green
lights
burning
upon
a
kind
of
basaltic
altar
and
a
bellrope
from
a
belfry
overhead
hanging
down
into
the
centre
of
the
place
Round
the
wall
ran
a
lettering
of
fire
in
a
character
unknown
to
him
While
he
was
still
wondering
at
the
purport
of
these
things
he
heard
the
receding
tramp
of
heavy
feet
echoing
far
down
the
street
He
ran
out
into
the
darkness
again
but
he
could
see
nothing
He
had
a
mind
to
pull
the
bellrope
and
finally
decided
to
follow
the
footsteps
But
although
he
ran
far
he
never
overtook
them
and
his
shouting
was
of
no
avail
The
gorge
seemed
to
extend
an
interminable
distance
It
was
as
dark
as
earthly
starlight
throughout
its
length
while
the
ghastly
green
day
lay
along
the
upper
edge
of
its
precipices
There
were
none
of
the
heads
now
below
They
were
all
it
seemed
busily
occupied
along
the
upper
slopes
Looking
up
he
saw
them
drifting
hither
and
thither
some
hovering
stationary
some
flying
swiftly
through
the
air
It
reminded
him
he
said
of
big
snowflakes
only
these
were
black
and
pale
green
In
pursuing
the
firm
undeviating
footsteps
that
he
never
overtook
in
groping
into
new
regions
of
this
endless
devils
dyke
in
clambering
up
and
down
the
pitiless
heights
in
wandering
about
the
summits
and
in
watching
the
drifting
faces
Plattner
states
that
he
spent
the
better
part
of
seven
or
eight
days
He
did
not
keep
count
he
says
Though
once
or
twice
he
found
eyes
watching
him
he
had
word
with
no
living
soul
He
slept
among
the
rocks
on
the
hillside
In
the
gorge
things
earthly
were
invisible
because
from
the
earthly
standpoint
it
was
far
underground
On
the
altitudes
so
soon
as
the
earthly
day
began
the
world
became
visible
to
him
He
found
himself
sometimes
stumbling
over
the
dark
green
rocks
or
arresting
himself
on
a
precipitous
brink
while
all
about
him
the
green
branches
of
the
Sussexville
lanes
were
swaying
or
again
he
seemed
to
be
walking
through
the
Sussexville
streets
or
watching
unseen
the
private
business
of
some
household
And
then
it
was
he
discovered
that
to
almost
every
human
being
in
our
world
there
pertained
some
of
these
drifting
heads
that
everyone
in
the
world
is
watched
intermittently
by
these
helpless
disembodiments
What
are
theythese
Watchers
of
the
Living
Plattner
never
learned
But
two
that
presently
found
and
followed
him
were
like
his
childhoods
memory
of
his
father
and
mother
Now
and
then
other
faces
turned
their
eyes
upon
him
eyes
like
those
of
dead
people
who
had
swayed
him
or
injured
him
or
helped
him
in
his
youth
and
manhood
Whenever
they
looked
at
him
Plattner
was
overcome
with
a
strange
sense
of
responsibility
To
his
mother
he
ventured
to
speak
but
she
made
no
answer
She
looked
sadly
steadfastly
and
tenderlya
little
reproachfully
too
it
seemedinto
his
eyes
He
simply
tells
this
story
he
does
not
endeavour
to
explain
We
are
left
to
surmise
who
these
Watchers
of
the
Living
may
be
or
if
they
are
indeed
the
Dead
why
they
should
so
closely
and
passionately
watch
a
world
they
have
left
for
ever
It
may
beindeed
to
my
mind
it
seems
justthat
when
our
life
has
closed
when
evil
or
good
is
no
longer
a
choice
for
us
we
may
still
have
to
witness
the
working
out
of
the
train
of
consequences
we
have
laid
If
human
souls
continue
after
death
then
surely
human
interests
continue
after
death
But
that
is
merely
my
own
guess
at
the
meaning
of
the
things
seen
Plattner
offers
no
interpretation
for
none
was
given
him
It
is
well
the
reader
should
understand
this
clearly
Day
after
day
with
his
head
reeling
he
wandered
about
this
strangelit
world
outside
the
world
weary
and
towards
the
end
weak
and
hungry
By
dayby
our
earthly
day
that
isthe
ghostly
vision
of
the
old
familiar
scenery
of
Sussexville
all
about
him
irked
and
worried
him
He
could
not
see
where
to
put
his
feet
and
ever
and
again
with
a
chilly
touch
one
of
these
Watching
Souls
would
come
against
his
face
And
after
dark
the
multitude
of
these
Watchers
about
him
and
their
intent
distress
confused
his
mind
beyond
describing
A
great
longing
to
return
to
the
earthly
life
that
was
so
near
and
yet
so
remote
consumed
him
The
unearthliness
of
things
about
him
produced
a
positively
painful
mental
distress
He
was
worried
beyond
describing
by
his
own
particular
followers
He
would
shout
at
them
to
desist
from
staring
at
him
scold
at
them
hurry
away
from
them
They
were
always
mute
and
intent
Run
as
he
might
over
the
uneven
ground
they
followed
his
destinies
On
the
ninth
day
towards
evening
Plattner
heard
the
invisible
footsteps
approaching
far
away
down
the
gorge
He
was
then
wandering
over
the
broad
crest
of
the
same
hill
upon
which
he
had
fallen
in
his
entry
into
this
strange
OtherWorld
of
his
He
turned
to
hurry
down
into
the
gorge
feeling
his
way
hastily
and
was
arrested
by
the
sight
of
the
thing
that
was
happening
in
a
room
in
a
back
street
near
the
school
Both
of
the
people
in
the
room
he
knew
by
sight
The
windows
were
open
the
blinds
up
and
the
setting
sun
shone
clearly
into
it
so
that
it
came
out
quite
brightly
at
first
a
vivid
oblong
of
room
lying
like
a
magiclantern
picture
upon
the
black
landscape
and
the
livid
green
dawn
In
addition
to
the
sunlight
a
candle
had
just
been
lit
in
the
room
On
the
bed
lay
a
lank
man
his
ghastly
white
face
terrible
upon
the
tumbled
pillow
His
clenched
hands
were
raised
above
his
head
A
little
table
beside
the
bed
carried
a
few
medicine
bottles
some
toast
and
water
and
an
empty
glass
Every
now
and
then
the
lank
mans
lips
fell
apart
to
indicate
a
word
he
could
not
articulate
But
the
woman
did
not
notice
that
he
wanted
anything
because
she
was
busy
turning
out
papers
from
an
oldfashioned
bureau
in
the
opposite
corner
of
the
room
At
first
the
picture
was
very
vivid
indeed
but
as
the
green
dawn
behind
it
grew
brighter
and
brighter
so
it
became
fainter
and
more
and
more
transparent
As
the
echoing
footsteps
paced
nearer
and
nearer
those
footsteps
that
sound
so
loud
in
that
OtherWorld
and
come
so
silently
in
this
Plattner
perceived
about
him
a
great
multitude
of
dim
faces
gathering
together
out
of
the
darkness
and
watching
the
two
people
in
the
room
Never
before
had
he
seen
so
many
of
the
Watchers
of
the
Living
A
multitude
had
eyes
only
for
the
sufferer
in
the
room
another
multitude
in
infinite
anguish
watched
the
woman
as
she
hunted
with
greedy
eyes
for
something
she
could
not
find
They
crowded
about
Plattner
they
came
across
his
sight
and
buffeted
his
face
the
noise
of
their
unavailing
regrets
was
all
about
him
He
saw
clearly
only
now
and
then
At
other
times
the
picture
quivered
dimly
through
the
veil
of
green
reflections
upon
their
movements
In
the
room
it
must
have
been
very
still
and
Plattner
says
the
candle
flame
streamed
up
into
a
perfectly
vertical
line
of
smoke
but
in
his
ears
each
footfall
and
its
echoes
beat
like
a
clap
of
thunder
And
the
faces!
Two
more
particularly
near
the
womans
one
a
womans
also
white
and
clearfeatured
a
face
which
might
have
once
been
cold
and
hard
but
which
was
now
softened
by
the
touch
of
a
wisdom
strange
to
earth
The
other
might
have
been
the
womans
father
Both
were
evidently
absorbed
in
the
contemplation
of
some
act
of
hateful
meanness
so
it
seemed
which
they
could
no
longer
guard
against
and
prevent
Behind
were
others
teachers
it
may
be
who
had
taught
ill
friends
whose
influence
had
failed
And
over
the
man
tooa
multitude
but
none
that
seemed
to
be
parents
or
teachers!
Faces
that
might
once
have
been
coarse
now
purged
to
strength
by
sorrow!
And
in
the
forefront
one
face
a
girlish
one
neither
angry
nor
remorseful
but
merely
patient
and
weary
and
as
it
seemed
to
Plattner
waiting
for
relief
His
powers
of
description
fail
him
at
the
memory
of
this
multitude
of
ghastly
countenances
They
gathered
on
the
stroke
of
the
bell
He
saw
them
all
in
the
space
of
a
second
It
would
seem
that
he
was
so
worked
on
by
his
excitement
that
quite
involuntarily
his
restless
fingers
took
the
bottle
of
green
powder
out
of
his
pocket
and
held
it
before
him
But
he
does
not
remember
that
Abruptly
the
footsteps
ceased
He
waited
for
the
next
and
there
was
silence
and
then
suddenly
cutting
through
the
unexpected
stillness
like
a
keen
thin
blade
came
the
first
stroke
of
the
bell
At
that
the
multitudinous
faces
swayed
to
and
fro
and
a
louder
crying
began
all
about
him
The
woman
did
not
hear
she
was
burning
something
now
in
the
candle
flame
At
the
second
stroke
everything
grew
dim
and
a
breath
of
wind
icy
cold
blew
through
the
host
of
watchers
They
swirled
about
him
like
an
eddy
of
dead
leaves
in
the
spring
and
at
the
third
stroke
something
was
extended
through
them
to
the
bed
You
have
heard
of
a
beam
of
light
This
was
like
a
beam
of
darkness
and
looking
again
at
it
Plattner
saw
that
it
was
a
shadowy
arm
and
hand
The
green
sun
was
now
topping
the
black
desolations
of
the
horizon
and
the
vision
of
the
room
was
very
faint
Plattner
could
see
that
the
white
of
the
bed
struggled
and
was
convulsed
and
that
the
woman
looked
round
over
her
shoulder
at
it
startled
The
cloud
of
watchers
lifted
high
like
a
puff
of
green
dust
before
the
wind
and
swept
swiftly
downward
towards
the
temple
in
the
gorge
Then
suddenly
Plattner
understood
the
meaning
of
the
shadowy
black
arm
that
stretched
across
his
shoulder
and
clutched
its
prey
He
did
not
dare
turn
his
head
to
see
the
Shadow
behind
the
arm
With
a
violent
effort
and
covering
his
eyes
he
set
himself
to
run
made
perhaps
twenty
strides
then
slipped
on
a
boulder
and
fell
He
fell
forward
on
his
hands
and
the
bottle
smashed
and
exploded
as
he
touched
the
ground
In
another
moment
he
found
himself
stunned
and
bleeding
sitting
face
to
face
with
Lidgett
in
the
old
walled
garden
behind
the
school





There
the
story
of
Plattners
experiences
ends
I
have
resisted
I
believe
successfully
the
natural
disposition
of
a
writer
of
fiction
to
dress
up
incidents
of
this
sort
I
have
told
the
thing
as
far
as
possible
in
the
order
in
which
Plattner
told
it
to
me
I
have
carefully
avoided
any
attempt
at
style
effect
or
construction
It
would
have
been
easy
for
instance
to
have
worked
the
scene
of
the
deathbed
into
a
kind
of
plot
in
which
Plattner
might
have
been
involved
But
quite
apart
from
the
objectionableness
of
falsifying
a
most
extraordinary
true
story
any
such
trite
devices
would
spoil
to
my
mind
the
peculiar
effect
of
this
dark
world
with
its
livid
green
illumination
and
its
drifting
Watchers
of
the
Living
which
unseen
and
unapproachable
to
us
is
yet
lying
all
about
us
It
remains
to
add
that
a
death
did
actually
occur
in
Vincent
Terrace
just
beyond
the
school
garden
and
so
far
as
can
be
proved
at
the
moment
of
Plattners
return
Deceased
was
a
ratecollector
and
insurance
agent
His
widow
who
was
much
younger
than
himself
married
last
month
a
Mr
Whymper
a
veterinary
surgeon
of
Allbeeding
As
the
portion
of
this
story
given
here
has
in
various
forms
circulated
orally
in
Sussexville
she
has
consented
to
my
use
of
her
name
on
condition
that
I
make
it
distinctly
known
that
she
emphatically
contradicts
every
detail
of
Plattners
account
of
her
husbands
last
moments
She
burnt
no
will
she
says
although
Plattner
never
accused
her
of
doing
so
her
husband
made
but
one
will
and
that
just
after
their
marriage
Certainly
from
a
man
who
had
never
seen
it
Plattners
account
of
the
furniture
of
the
room
was
curiously
accurate
One
other
thing
even
at
the
risk
of
an
irksome
repetition
I
must
insist
upon
lest
I
seem
to
favour
the
credulous
superstitious
view
Plattners
absence
from
the
world
for
nine
days
is
I
think
proved
But
that
does
not
prove
his
story
It
is
quite
conceivable
that
even
outside
space
hallucinations
may
be
possible
That
at
least
the
reader
must
bear
distinctly
in
mind
THE
ARGONAUTS
OF
THE
AIR
One
saw
Monsons
Flying
Machine
from
the
windows
of
the
trains
passing
either
along
the
SouthWestern
main
line
or
along
the
line
between
Wimbledon
and
Worcester
Parkto
be
more
exact
one
saw
the
huge
scaffoldings
which
limited
the
flight
of
the
apparatus
They
rose
over
the
treetops
a
massive
alley
of
interlacing
iron
and
timber
and
an
enormous
web
of
ropes
and
tackle
extending
the
best
part
of
two
miles
From
the
Leatherhead
branch
this
alley
was
foreshortened
and
in
part
hidden
by
a
hill
with
villas
but
from
the
main
line
one
had
it
in
profile
a
complex
tangle
of
girders
and
curving
bars
very
impressive
to
the
excursionists
from
Portsmouth
and
Southampton
and
the
West
Monson
had
taken
up
the
work
where
Maxim
had
left
it
had
gone
on
at
first
with
an
utter
contempt
for
the
journalistic
wit
and
ignorance
that
had
irritated
and
hampered
his
predecessor
and
had
spent
it
was
said
rather
more
than
half
his
immense
fortune
upon
his
experiments
The
results
to
an
impatient
generation
seemed
inconsiderable
When
some
five
years
had
passed
after
the
growth
of
the
colossal
iron
groves
at
Worcester
Park
and
Monson
still
failed
to
put
in
a
fluttering
appearance
over
Trafalgar
Square
even
the
Isle
of
Wight
trippers
felt
their
liberty
to
smile
And
such
intelligent
people
as
did
not
consider
Monson
a
fool
stricken
with
the
mania
for
invention
denounced
him
as
being
for
no
particular
reason
a
selfadvertising
quack
Yet
now
and
again
a
morning
trainload
of
seasonticket
holders
would
see
a
white
monster
rush
headlong
through
the
airy
tracery
of
guides
and
bars
and
hear
the
further
stays
nettings
and
buffers
snap
creak
and
groan
with
the
impact
of
the
blow
Then
there
would
be
an
efflorescence
of
blackset
whiterimmed
faces
along
the
sides
of
the
train
and
the
morning
papers
would
be
neglected
for
a
vigorous
discussion
of
the
possibility
of
flying
in
which
nothing
new
was
ever
said
by
any
chance
until
the
train
reached
Waterloo
and
its
cargo
of
seasonticket
holders
dispersed
themselves
over
London
Or
the
fathers
and
mothers
in
some
multitudinous
train
of
weary
excursionists
returning
exhausted
from
a
day
of
rest
by
the
sea
would
find
the
dark
fabric
standing
out
against
the
evening
sky
useful
in
diverting
some
bilious
child
from
its
introspection
and
be
suddenly
startled
by
the
swift
transit
of
a
huge
black
flapping
shape
that
strained
upward
against
the
guides
It
was
a
great
and
forcible
thing
beyond
dispute
and
excellent
for
conversation
yet
all
the
same
it
was
but
flying
in
leadingstrings
and
most
of
those
who
witnessed
it
scarcely
counted
its
flight
as
flying
More
of
a
switchback
it
seemed
to
the
run
of
the
folk
Monson
I
say
did
not
trouble
himself
very
keenly
about
the
opinions
of
the
press
at
first
But
possibly
he
even
had
formed
but
a
poor
idea
of
the
time
it
would
take
before
the
tactics
of
flying
were
mastered
the
swift
assured
adjustment
of
the
big
soaring
shape
to
every
gust
and
chance
movement
of
the
air
nor
had
he
clearly
reckoned
the
money
this
prolonged
struggle
against
gravitation
would
cost
him
And
he
was
not
so
pachydermatous
as
he
seemed
Secretly
he
had
his
periodical
bundles
of
cuttings
sent
him
by
Romeike
he
had
his
periodical
reminders
from
his
banker
and
if
he
did
not
mind
the
initial
ridicule
and
scepticism
he
felt
the
growing
neglect
as
the
months
went
by
and
the
money
dribbled
away
Time
was
when
Monson
had
sent
the
enterprising
journalist
keen
after
readable
matter
empty
from
his
gates
But
when
the
enterprising
journalist
ceased
from
troubling
Monson
was
anything
but
satisfied
in
his
heart
of
hearts
Still
day
by
day
the
work
went
on
and
the
multitudinous
subtle
difficulties
of
the
steering
diminished
in
number
Day
by
day
too
the
money
trickled
away
until
his
balance
was
no
longer
a
matter
of
hundreds
of
thousands
but
of
tens
And
at
last
came
an
anniversary
Monson
sitting
in
the
little
drawingshed
suddenly
noticed
the
date
on
Woodhouses
calendar
It
was
five
years
ago
today
that
we
began
he
said
to
Woodhouse
suddenly
Is
it
said
Woodhouse
Its
the
alterations
play
the
devil
with
us
said
Monson
biting
a
paperfastener
The
drawings
for
the
new
vans
to
the
hinder
screw
lay
on
the
table
before
him
as
he
spoke
He
pitched
the
mutilated
brass
paperfastener
into
the
wastepaper
basket
and
drummed
with
his
fingers
These
alterations!
Will
the
mathematicians
ever
be
clever
enough
to
save
us
all
this
patching
and
experimenting
Five
yearslearning
by
rule
of
thumb
when
one
might
think
that
it
was
possible
to
calculate
the
whole
thing
out
beforehand
The
cost
of
it!
I
might
have
hired
three
senior
wranglers
for
life
But
theyd
only
have
developed
some
beautifully
useless
theorems
in
pneumatics
What
a
time
it
has
been
Woodhouse!
These
mouldings
will
take
three
weeks
said
Woodhouse
At
special
prices
Three
weeks!
said
Monson
and
sat
drumming
Three
weeks
certain
said
Woodhouse
an
excellent
engineer
but
no
good
as
a
comforter
He
drew
the
sheets
towards
him
and
began
shading
a
bar
Monson
stopped
drumming
and
began
to
bite
his
fingernails
staring
the
while
at
Woodhouses
head
How
long
have
they
been
calling
this
Monsons
Folly
he
said
suddenly
Oh!
Year
or
so
said
Woodhouse
carelessly
without
looking
up
Monson
sucked
the
air
in
between
his
teeth
and
went
to
the
window
The
stout
iron
columns
carrying
the
elevated
rails
upon
which
the
start
of
the
machine
was
made
rose
up
close
by
and
the
machine
was
hidden
by
the
upper
edge
of
the
window
Through
the
grove
of
iron
pillars
red
painted
and
ornate
with
rows
of
bolts
one
had
a
glimpse
of
the
pretty
scenery
towards
Esher
A
train
went
gliding
noiselessly
across
the
middle
distance
its
rattle
drowned
by
the
hammering
of
the
workmen
overhead
Monson
could
imagine
the
grinning
faces
at
the
windows
of
the
carriages
He
swore
savagely
under
his
breath
and
dabbed
viciously
at
a
blowfly
that
suddenly
became
noisy
on
the
windowpane
Whats
up
said
Woodhouse
staring
in
surprise
at
his
employer
Im
about
sick
of
this
Woodhouse
scratched
his
cheek
Oh!
he
said
after
an
assimilating
pause
He
pushed
the
drawing
away
from
him
Here
these
fools

Im
trying
to
conquer
a
new
elementtrying
to
do
a
thing
that
will
revolutionise
life
And
instead
of
taking
an
intelligent
interest
they
grin
and
make
their
stupid
jokes
and
call
me
and
my
appliances
names
Asses!
said
Woodhouse
letting
his
eye
fall
again
on
the
drawing
The
epithet
curiously
enough
made
Monson
wince
Im
about
sick
of
it
Woodhouse
anyhow
he
said
after
a
pause
Woodhouse
shrugged
his
shoulders
Theres
nothing
for
it
but
patience
I
suppose
said
Monson
sticking
his
hands
in
his
pockets
Ive
started
Ive
made
my
bed
and
Ive
got
to
lie
on
it
I
cant
go
back
Ill
see
it
through
and
spend
every
penny
I
have
and
every
penny
I
can
borrow
But
I
tell
you
Woodhouse
Im
infernally
sick
of
it
all
the
same
If
Id
paid
a
tenth
part
of
the
money
towards
some
political
greasers
expensesId
have
been
a
baronet
before
this
Monson
paused
Woodhouse
stared
in
front
of
him
with
a
blank
expression
he
always
employed
to
indicate
sympathy
and
tapped
his
pencilcase
on
the
table
Monson
stared
at
him
for
a
minute
Oh
damn!
said
Monson
suddenly
and
abruptly
rushed
out
of
the
room
Woodhouse
continued
his
sympathetic
rigour
for
perhaps
half
a
minute
Then
he
sighed
and
resumed
the
shading
of
the
drawings
Something
had
evidently
upset
Monson
Nice
chap
and
generous
but
difficult
to
get
on
with
It
was
the
way
with
every
amateur
who
had
anything
to
do
with
engineeringwanted
everything
finished
at
once
But
Monson
had
usually
the
patience
of
the
expert
Odd
he
was
so
irritable
Nice
and
round
that
aluminium
rod
did
look
now!
Woodhouse
threw
back
his
head
and
put
it
first
this
side
and
then
that
to
appreciate
his
bit
of
shading
better
Mr
Woodhouse
said
Hooper
the
foreman
of
the
labourers
putting
his
head
in
at
the
door
Hullo!
said
Woodhouse
without
turning
round
Nothing
happened
sir
said
Hooper
Happened
said
Woodhouse
The
governor
just
been
up
the
rails
swearing
like
a
tornader
Oh!
said
Woodhouse
It
aint
like
him
sir
No
And
I
was
thinking
perhaps
Dont
think
said
Woodhouse
still
admiring
the
drawings
Hooper
knew
Woodhouse
and
he
shut
the
door
suddenly
with
a
vicious
slam
Woodhouse
stared
stonily
before
him
for
some
further
minutes
and
then
made
an
ineffectual
effort
to
pick
his
teeth
with
his
pencil
Abruptly
he
desisted
pitched
that
old
tried
and
stumpy
servitor
across
the
room
got
up
stretched
himself
and
followed
Hooper
He
looked
ruffledit
was
visible
to
every
workman
he
met
When
a
millionaire
who
has
been
spending
thousands
on
experiments
that
employ
quite
a
little
army
of
people
suddenly
indicates
that
he
is
sick
of
the
undertaking
there
is
almost
invariably
a
certain
amount
of
mental
friction
in
the
ranks
of
the
little
army
he
employs
And
even
before
he
indicates
his
intentions
there
are
speculations
and
murmurs
a
watching
of
faces
and
a
study
of
straws
Hundreds
of
people
knew
before
the
day
was
out
that
Monson
was
ruffled
Woodhouse
ruffled
Hooper
ruffled
A
workmans
wife
for
instance
whom
Monson
had
never
seen
decided
to
keep
her
money
in
the
savingsbank
instead
of
buying
a
velveteen
dress
So
farreaching
are
even
the
casual
curses
of
a
millionaire
Monson
found
a
certain
satisfaction
in
going
on
the
works
and
behaving
disagreeably
to
as
many
people
as
possible
After
a
time
even
that
palled
upon
him
and
he
rode
off
the
grounds
to
every
ones
relief
there
and
through
the
lanes
southeastward
to
the
infinite
tribulation
of
his
house
steward
at
Cheam
And
the
immediate
cause
of
it
all
the
little
grain
of
annoyance
that
had
suddenly
precipitated
all
this
discontent
with
his
lifework
wasthese
trivial
things
that
direct
all
our
great
decisions!half
a
dozen
illconsidered
remarks
made
by
a
pretty
girl
prettily
dressed
with
a
beautiful
voice
and
something
more
than
prettiness
in
her
soft
grey
eyes
And
of
these
halfdozen
remarks
two
words
especiallyMonsons
Folly
She
had
felt
she
was
behaving
charmingly
to
Monson
she
reflected
the
next
day
how
exceptionally
effective
she
had
been
and
no
one
would
have
been
more
amazed
than
she
had
she
learned
the
effect
she
had
left
on
Monsons
mind
I
hope
considering
everything
that
she
never
knew
How
are
you
getting
on
with
your
flyingmachine
she
asked
I
wonder
if
I
shall
ever
meet
any
one
with
the
sense
not
to
ask
that
thought
Monson
It
will
be
very
dangerous
at
first
will
it
not
Thinks
Im
afraid
Jorgon
is
going
to
play
presently
have
you
heard
him
before
My
mania
being
attended

we
turn
to
rational
conversation
Gush
about
Jorgon
gradual
decline
of
conversation
ending
withYou
must
let
me
know
when
your
flyingmachine
is
finished
Mr
Monson
and
then
I
will
consider
the
advisability
of
taking
a
ticket
One
would
think
I
was
still
playing
inventions
in
the
nursery
But
the
bitterest
thing
she
said
was
not
meant
for
Monsons
ears
To
Phlox
the
novelist
she
was
always
conscientiously
brilliant
I
have
been
talking
to
Mr
Monson
and
he
can
think
of
nothing
positively
nothing
but
that
flyingmachine
of
his
Do
you
know
all
his
workmen
call
that
place
of
his
Monsons
Folly
He
is
quite
impossible
It
is
really
very
very
sad
I
always
regard
him
myself
in
the
light
of
sunken
treasurethe
Lost
Millionaire
you
know
She
was
pretty
and
well
educatedindeed
she
had
written
an
epigrammatic
novelette
but
the
bitterness
was
that
she
was
typical
She
summarised
what
the
world
thought
of
the
man
who
was
working
sanely
steadily
and
surely
towards
a
more
tremendous
revolution
in
the
appliances
of
civilisation
a
more
farreaching
alteration
in
the
ways
of
humanity
than
has
ever
been
effected
since
history
began
They
did
not
even
take
him
seriously
In
a
little
while
he
would
be
proverbial
I
must
fly
now
he
said
on
his
way
home
smarting
with
a
sense
of
absolute
social
failure
I
must
fly
soon
If
it
doesnt
come
off
soon
by
God!
I
shall
run
amuck
He
said
that
before
he
had
gone
through
his
passbook
and
his
litter
of
papers
Inadequate
as
the
cause
seems
it
was
that
girls
voice
and
the
expression
of
her
eyes
that
precipitated
his
discontent
But
certainly
the
discovery
that
he
had
no
longer
even
one
hundred
thousand
pounds
worth
of
realisable
property
behind
him
was
the
poison
that
made
the
wound
deadly
It
was
the
next
day
after
this
that
he
exploded
upon
Woodhouse
and
his
workmen
and
thereafter
his
bearing
was
consistently
grim
for
three
weeks
and
anxiety
dwelt
in
Cheam
and
Ewell
Malden
Morden
and
Worcester
Park
places
that
had
thriven
mightily
on
his
experiments
Four
weeks
after
that
first
swearing
of
his
he
stood
with
Woodhouse
by
the
reconstructed
machine
as
it
lay
across
the
elevated
railway
by
means
of
which
it
gained
its
initial
impetus
The
new
propeller
glittered
a
brighter
white
than
the
rest
of
the
machine
and
a
gilder
obedient
to
a
whim
of
Monsons
was
picking
out
the
aluminium
bars
with
gold
And
looking
down
the
long
avenue
between
the
ropes
gilded
now
with
the
sunset
one
saw
red
signals
and
two
miles
away
an
anthill
of
workmen
busy
altering
the
last
falls
of
the
run
into
a
rising
slope
Ill
come
said
Woodhouse
Ill
come
right
enough
But
I
tell
you
its
infernally
foolhardy
If
only
you
would
give
another
year
I
tell
you
I
wont
I
tell
you
the
thing
works
Ive
given
years
enough
Its
not
that
said
Woodhouse
Were
all
right
with
the
machine
But
its
the
steering
Havent
I
been
rushing
night
and
morning
backwards
and
forwards
through
this
squirrels
cage
If
the
thing
steers
true
here
it
will
steer
true
all
across
England
Its
just
funk
I
tell
you
Woodhouse
We
could
have
gone
a
year
ago
And
besides
Well
said
Woodhouse
The
money!
snapped
Monson
over
his
shoulder
Hang
it!
I
never
thought
of
the
money
said
Woodhouse
and
then
speaking
now
in
a
very
different
tone
to
that
with
which
he
had
said
the
words
before
he
repeated
Ill
come
Trust
me
Monson
turned
suddenly
and
saw
all
that
Woodhouse
had
not
the
dexterity
to
say
shining
on
his
sunsetlit
face
He
looked
for
a
moment
then
impulsively
extended
his
hand
Thanks
he
said
All
right
said
Woodhouse
gripping
the
hand
and
with
a
queer
softening
of
his
features
Trust
me
Then
both
men
turned
to
the
big
apparatus
that
lay
with
its
flat
wings
extended
upon
the
carrier
and
stared
at
it
meditatively
Monson
guided
perhaps
by
a
photographic
study
of
the
flight
of
birds
and
by
Lilienthals
methods
had
gradually
drifted
from
Maxims
shapes
towards
the
bird
form
again
The
thing
however
was
driven
by
a
huge
screw
behind
in
the
place
of
the
tail
and
so
hovering
which
needs
an
almost
vertical
adjustment
of
a
flat
tail
was
rendered
impossible
The
body
of
the
machine
was
small
almost
cylindrical
and
pointed
Forward
and
aft
on
the
pointed
ends
were
two
small
petroleum
engines
for
the
screw
and
the
navigators
sat
deep
in
a
canoelike
recess
the
foremost
one
steering
and
being
protected
by
a
low
screen
with
two
plateglass
windows
from
the
blinding
rush
of
air
On
either
side
a
monstrous
flat
framework
with
a
curved
front
border
could
be
adjusted
so
as
either
to
lie
horizontally
or
to
be
tilted
upward
or
down
These
wings
worked
rigidly
together
or
by
releasing
a
pin
one
could
be
tilted
through
a
small
angle
independently
of
its
fellow
The
front
edge
of
either
wing
could
also
be
shifted
back
so
as
to
diminish
the
wingarea
about
onesixth
The
machine
was
not
only
not
designed
to
hover
but
it
was
also
incapable
of
fluttering
Monsons
idea
was
to
get
into
the
air
with
the
initial
rush
of
the
apparatus
and
then
to
skim
much
as
a
playingcard
may
be
skimmed
keeping
up
the
rush
by
means
of
the
screw
at
the
stern
Rooks
and
gulls
fly
enormous
distances
in
that
way
with
scarcely
a
perceptible
movement
of
the
wings
The
bird
really
drives
along
on
an
a
rial
switchback
It
glides
slanting
downward
for
a
space
until
it
has
gained
considerable
momentum
and
then
altering
the
inclination
of
its
wings
glides
up
again
almost
to
its
original
altitude
Even
a
Londoner
who
has
watched
the
birds
in
the
aviary
in
Regents
Park
knows
that
But
the
bird
is
practising
this
art
from
the
moment
it
leaves
its
nest
It
has
not
only
the
perfect
apparatus
but
the
perfect
instinct
to
use
it
A
man
off
his
feet
has
the
poorest
skill
in
balancing
Even
the
simple
trick
of
the
bicycle
costs
him
some
hours
of
labour
The
instantaneous
adjustments
of
the
wings
the
quick
response
to
a
passing
breeze
the
swift
recovery
of
equilibrium
the
giddy
eddying
movements
that
require
such
absolute
precisionall
that
he
must
learn
learn
with
infinite
labour
and
infinite
danger
if
ever
he
is
to
conquer
flying
The
flyingmachine
that
will
start
off
some
fine
day
driven
by
neat
little
levers
with
a
nice
open
deck
like
a
liner
and
all
loaded
up
with
bombshells
and
guns
is
the
easy
dreaming
of
a
literary
man
In
lives
and
in
treasure
the
cost
of
the
conquest
of
the
empire
of
the
air
may
even
exceed
all
that
has
been
spent
in
mans
great
conquest
of
the
sea
Certainly
it
will
be
costlier
than
the
greatest
war
that
has
ever
devastated
the
world
No
one
knew
these
things
better
than
these
two
practical
men
And
they
knew
they
were
in
the
front
rank
of
the
coming
army
Yet
there
is
hope
even
in
a
forlorn
hope
Men
are
killed
outright
in
the
reserves
sometimes
while
others
who
have
been
left
for
dead
in
the
thickest
corner
crawl
out
and
survive
If
we
miss
these
meadowssaid
Woodhouse
presently
in
his
slow
way
My
dear
chap
said
Monson
whose
spirits
had
been
rising
fitfully
during
the
last
few
days
we
mustnt
miss
these
meadows
Theres
a
quarter
of
a
square
mile
for
us
to
hit
fences
removed
ditches
levelled
We
shall
come
down
all
rightrest
assured
And
if
we
dont
Ah!
said
Woodhouse
If
we
dont!
Before
the
day
of
the
start
the
newspaper
people
got
wind
of
the
alterations
at
the
northward
end
of
the
framework
and
Monson
was
cheered
by
a
decided
change
in
the
comments
Romeike
forwarded
him
He
will
be
off
some
day
said
the
papers
He
will
be
off
some
day
said
the
SouthWestern
seasonticket
holders
one
to
another
the
seaside
excursionists
the
SaturdaytoMonday
trippers
from
Sussex
and
Hampshire
and
Dorset
and
Devon
the
eminent
literary
people
from
Hazlemere
all
remarked
eagerly
one
to
another
He
will
be
off
some
day
as
the
familiar
scaffolding
came
in
sight
And
actually
one
bright
morning
in
full
view
of
the
tenpastten
train
from
Basingstoke
Monsons
flyingmachine
started
on
its
journey
They
saw
the
carrier
running
swiftly
along
its
rail
and
the
white
and
gold
screw
spinning
in
the
air
They
heard
the
rapid
rumble
of
wheels
and
a
thud
as
the
carrier
reached
the
buffers
at
the
end
of
its
run
Then
a
whirr
as
the
FlyingMachine
was
shot
forward
into
the
networks
All
that
the
majority
of
them
had
seen
and
heard
before
The
thing
went
with
a
drooping
flight
through
the
framework
and
rose
again
and
then
every
beholder
shouted
or
screamed
or
yelled
or
shrieked
after
his
kind
For
instead
of
the
customary
concussion
and
stoppage
the
Flying
Machine
flew
out
of
its
five
years
cage
like
a
bolt
from
a
crossbow
and
drove
slantingly
upward
into
the
air
curved
round
a
little
so
as
to
cross
the
line
and
soared
in
the
direction
of
Wimbledon
Common
It
seemed
to
hang
momentarily
in
the
air
and
grow
smaller
then
it
ducked
and
vanished
over
the
clustering
blue
treetops
to
the
east
of
Coombe
Hill
and
no
one
stopped
staring
and
gasping
until
long
after
it
had
disappeared
That
was
what
the
people
in
the
train
from
Basingstoke
saw
If
you
had
drawn
a
line
down
the
middle
of
that
train
from
engine
to
guards
van
you
would
not
have
found
a
living
soul
on
the
opposite
side
to
the
flyingmachine
It
was
a
mad
rush
from
window
to
window
as
the
thing
crossed
the
line
And
the
enginedriver
and
stoker
never
took
their
eyes
off
the
low
hills
about
Wimbledon
and
never
noticed
that
they
had
run
clean
through
Coombe
and
Maiden
and
Raynes
Park
until
with
returning
animation
they
found
themselves
pelting
at
the
most
indecent
pace
into
Wimbledon
station
From
the
moment
when
Monson
had
started
the
carrier
with
a
Now!
neither
he
nor
Woodhouse
said
a
word
Both
men
sat
with
clenched
teeth
Monson
had
crossed
the
line
with
a
curve
that
was
too
sharp
and
Woodhouse
had
opened
and
shut
his
white
lips
but
neither
spoke
Woodhouse
simply
gripped
his
seat
and
breathed
sharply
through
his
teeth
watching
the
blue
country
to
the
west
rushing
past
and
down
and
away
from
him
Monson
knelt
at
his
post
forward
and
his
hands
trembled
on
the
spoked
wheel
that
moved
the
wings
He
could
see
nothing
before
him
but
a
mass
of
white
clouds
in
the
sky
The
machine
went
slanting
upward
travelling
with
an
enormous
speed
still
but
losing
momentum
every
moment
The
land
ran
away
underneath
with
diminishing
speed
Now!
said
Woodhouse
at
last
and
with
a
violent
effort
Monson
wrenched
over
the
wheel
and
altered
the
angle
of
the
wings
The
machine
seemed
to
hang
for
half
a
minute
motionless
in
midair
and
then
he
saw
the
hazy
blue
housecovered
hills
of
Kilburn
and
Hampstead
jump
up
before
his
eyes
and
rise
steadily
until
the
little
sunlit
dome
of
the
Albert
Hall
appeared
through
his
windows
For
a
moment
he
scarcely
understood
the
meaning
of
this
upward
rush
of
the
horizon
but
as
the
nearer
and
nearer
houses
came
into
view
he
realised
what
he
had
done
He
had
turned
the
wings
over
too
far
and
they
were
swooping
steeply
downward
towards
the
Thames
The
thought
the
question
the
realisation
were
all
the
business
of
a
second
of
time
Too
much!
gasped
Woodhouse
Monson
brought
the
wheel
halfway
back
with
a
jerk
and
forthwith
the
Kilburn
and
Hampstead
ridge
dropped
again
to
the
lower
edge
of
his
windows
They
had
been
a
thousand
feet
above
Coombe
and
Maiden
station
fifty
seconds
after
they
whizzed
at
a
frightful
pace
not
eighty
feet
above
the
East
Putney
station
on
the
Metropolitan
District
line
to
the
screaming
astonishment
of
a
platformful
of
people
Monson
flung
up
the
vans
against
the
air
and
over
Fulham
they
rushed
up
their
atmospheric
switchback
again
steeplytoo
steeply
The
buses
went
floundering
across
the
Fulham
Road
the
people
yelled
Then
down
again
too
steeply
still
and
the
distant
trees
and
houses
about
Primrose
Hill
leapt
up
across
Monsons
window
and
then
suddenly
he
saw
straight
before
him
the
greenery
of
Kensington
Gardens
and
the
towers
of
the
Imperial
Institute
They
were
driving
straight
down
upon
South
Kensington
The
pinnacles
of
the
Natural
History
Museum
rushed
up
into
view
There
came
one
fatal
second
of
swift
thought
a
moment
of
hesitation
Should
he
try
and
clear
the
towers
or
swerve
eastward
He
made
a
hesitating
attempt
to
release
the
right
wing
left
the
catch
half
released
and
gave
a
frantic
clutch
at
the
wheel
The
nose
of
the
machine
seemed
to
leap
up
before
him
The
wheel
pressed
his
hand
with
irresistible
force
and
jerked
itself
out
of
his
control
Woodhouse
sitting
crouched
together
gave
a
hoarse
cry
and
sprang
up
towards
Monson
Too
far!
he
cried
and
then
he
was
clinging
to
the
gunwale
for
dear
life
and
Monson
had
been
jerked
clean
overhead
and
was
falling
backwards
upon
him
So
swiftly
had
the
thing
happened
that
barely
a
quarter
of
the
people
going
to
and
fro
in
Hyde
Park
and
Brompton
Road
and
the
Exhibition
Road
saw
anything
of
the
a
rial
catastrophe
A
distant
winged
shape
had
appeared
above
the
clustering
houses
to
the
south
had
fallen
and
risen
growing
larger
as
it
did
so
had
swooped
swiftly
down
towards
the
Imperial
Institute
a
broad
spread
of
flying
wings
had
swept
round
in
a
quarter
circle
dashed
eastward
and
then
suddenly
sprang
vertically
into
the
air
A
black
object
shot
out
of
it
and
came
spinning
downward
A
man!
Two
men
clutching
each
other!
They
came
whirling
down
separated
as
they
struck
the
roof
of
the
Students
Club
and
bounded
off
into
the
green
bushes
on
its
southward
side
For
perhaps
half
a
minute
the
pointed
stem
of
the
big
machine
still
pierced
vertically
upward
the
screw
spinning
desperately
For
one
brief
instant
that
yet
seemed
an
age
to
all
who
watched
it
had
hung
motionless
in
midair
Then
a
spout
of
yellow
flame
licked
up
its
length
from
the
stern
engine
and
swift
swifter
swifter
and
flaring
like
a
rocket
it
rushed
down
upon
the
solid
mass
of
masonry
which
was
formerly
the
Royal
College
of
Science
The
big
screw
of
white
and
gold
touched
the
parapet
and
crumpled
up
like
wet
linen
Then
the
blazing
spindleshaped
body
smashed
and
splintered
smashing
and
splintering
in
its
fall
upon
the
northwestward
angle
of
the
building
But
the
crash
the
flame
of
blazing
paraffin
that
shot
heavenward
from
the
shattered
engines
of
the
machine
the
crushed
horrors
that
were
found
in
the
garden
beyond
the
Students
Club
the
masses
of
yellow
parapet
and
red
brick
that
fell
headlong
into
the
roadway
the
running
to
and
fro
of
people
like
ants
in
a
broken
anthill
the
galloping
of
fireengines
the
gathering
of
crowdsall
these
things
do
not
belong
to
this
story
which
was
written
only
to
tell
how
the
first
of
all
successful
flyingmachines
was
launched
and
flew
Though
he
failed
and
failed
disastrously
the
record
of
Monsons
work
remainsa
sufficient
monumentto
guide
the
next
of
that
band
of
gallant
experimentalists
who
will
sooner
or
later
master
this
great
problem
of
flying
And
between
Worcester
Park
and
Malden
there
still
stands
that
portentous
avenue
of
ironwork
rusting
now
and
dangerous
here
and
there
to
witness
to
the
first
desperate
struggle
for
mans
right
of
way
through
the
air
THE
STORY
OF
THE
LATE
MR
ELVESHAM
I
set
this
story
down
not
expecting
it
will
be
believed
but
if
possible
to
prepare
a
way
of
escape
for
the
next
victim
He
perhaps
may
profit
by
my
misfortune
My
own
case
I
know
is
hopeless
and
I
am
now
in
some
measure
prepared
to
meet
my
fate
My
name
is
Edward
George
Eden
I
was
born
at
Trentham
in
Staffordshire
my
father
being
employed
in
the
gardens
there
I
lost
my
mother
when
I
was
three
years
old
and
my
father
when
I
was
five
my
uncle
George
Eden
then
adopting
me
as
his
own
son
He
was
a
single
man
selfeducated
and
wellknown
in
Birmingham
as
an
enterprising
journalist
he
educated
me
generously
fired
my
ambition
to
succeed
in
the
world
and
at
his
death
which
happened
four
years
ago
left
me
his
entire
fortune
a
matter
of
about
five
hundred
pounds
after
all
outgoing
charges
were
paid
I
was
then
eighteen
He
advised
me
in
his
will
to
expend
the
money
in
completing
my
education
I
had
already
chosen
the
profession
of
medicine
and
through
his
posthumous
generosity
and
my
good
fortune
in
a
scholarship
competition
I
became
a
medical
student
at
University
College
London
At
the
time
of
the
beginning
of
my
story
I
lodged
at
A
University
Street
in
a
little
upper
room
very
shabbily
furnished
and
draughty
overlooking
the
back
of
Shoolbreds
premises
I
used
this
little
room
both
to
live
in
and
sleep
in
because
I
was
anxious
to
eke
out
my
means
to
the
very
last
shillingsworth
I
was
taking
a
pair
of
shoes
to
be
mended
at
a
shop
in
the
Tottenham
Court
Road
when
I
first
encountered
the
little
old
man
with
the
yellow
face
with
whom
my
life
has
now
become
so
inextricably
entangled
He
was
standing
on
the
kerb
and
staring
at
the
number
on
the
door
in
a
doubtful
way
as
I
opened
it
His
eyesthey
were
dull
grey
eyes
and
reddish
under
the
rimsfell
to
my
face
and
his
countenance
immediately
assumed
an
expression
of
corrugated
amiability
You
come
he
said
apt
to
the
moment
I
had
forgotten
the
number
of
your
house
How
do
you
do
Mr
Eden
I
was
a
little
astonished
at
his
familiar
address
for
I
had
never
set
eyes
on
the
man
before
I
was
a
little
annoyed
too
at
his
catching
me
with
my
boots
under
my
arm
He
noticed
my
lack
of
cordiality
Wonder
who
the
deuce
I
am
eh
A
friend
let
me
assure
you
I
have
seen
you
before
though
you
havent
seen
me
Is
there
anywhere
where
I
can
talk
to
you
I
hesitated
The
shabbiness
of
my
room
upstairs
was
not
a
matter
for
every
stranger
Perhaps
said
I
we
might
walk
down
the
street
Im
unfortunately
preventedMy
gesture
explained
the
sentence
before
I
had
spoken
it
The
very
thing
he
said
and
faced
this
way
and
then
that
The
street
Which
way
shall
we
go
I
slipped
my
boots
down
in
the
passage
Look
here!
he
said
abruptly
this
business
of
mine
is
a
rigmarole
Come
and
lunch
with
me
Mr
Eden
Im
an
old
man
a
very
old
man
and
not
good
at
explanations
and
what
with
my
piping
voice
and
the
clatter
of
the
traffic
He
laid
a
persuasive
skinny
hand
that
trembled
a
little
upon
my
arm
I
was
not
so
old
that
an
old
man
might
not
treat
me
to
a
lunch
Yet
at
the
same
time
I
was
not
altogether
pleased
by
this
abrupt
invitation
I
had
ratherI
began
But
I
had
rather
he
said
catching
me
up
and
a
certain
civility
is
surely
due
to
my
grey
hairs
And
so
I
consented
and
went
with
him
He
took
me
to
Blavitskis
I
had
to
walk
slowly
to
accommodate
myself
to
his
paces
and
over
such
a
lunch
as
I
had
never
tasted
before
he
fended
off
my
leading
questions
and
I
took
a
better
note
of
his
appearance
His
cleanshaven
face
was
lean
and
wrinkled
his
shrivelled
lips
fell
over
a
set
of
false
teeth
and
his
white
hair
was
thin
and
rather
long
he
seemed
small
to
methough
indeed
most
people
seemed
small
to
meand
his
shoulders
were
rounded
and
bent
And
watching
him
I
could
not
help
but
observe
that
he
too
was
taking
note
of
me
running
his
eyes
with
a
curious
touch
of
greed
in
them
over
me
from
my
broad
shoulders
to
my
suntanned
hands
and
up
to
my
freckled
face
again
And
now
said
he
as
we
lit
our
cigarettes
I
must
tell
you
of
the
business
in
hand
I
must
tell
you
then
that
I
am
an
old
man
a
very
old
man
He
paused
momentarily
And
it
happens
that
I
have
money
that
I
must
presently
be
leaving
and
never
a
child
have
I
to
leave
it
to
I
thought
of
the
confidence
trick
and
resolved
I
would
be
on
the
alert
for
the
vestiges
of
my
five
hundred
pounds
He
proceeded
to
enlarge
on
his
loneliness
and
the
trouble
he
had
to
find
a
proper
disposition
of
his
money
I
have
weighed
this
plan
and
that
plan
charities
institutions
and
scholarships
and
libraries
and
I
have
come
to
this
conclusion
at
lasthe
fixed
his
eyes
on
my
facethat
I
will
find
some
young
fellow
ambitious
pureminded
and
poor
healthy
in
body
and
healthy
in
mind
and
in
short
make
him
my
heir
give
him
all
that
I
have
He
repeated
Give
him
all
that
I
have
So
that
he
will
suddenly
be
lifted
out
of
all
the
trouble
and
struggle
in
which
his
sympathies
have
been
educated
to
freedom
and
influence
I
tried
to
seem
disinterested
With
a
transparent
hypocrisy
I
said
And
you
want
my
help
my
professional
services
maybe
to
find
that
person
He
smiled
and
looked
at
me
over
his
cigarette
and
I
laughed
at
his
quiet
exposure
of
my
modest
pretence
What
a
career
such
a
man
might
have!
he
said
It
fills
me
with
envy
to
think
how
I
have
accumulated
that
another
man
may
spend
But
there
are
conditions
of
course
burdens
to
be
imposed
He
must
for
instance
take
my
name
You
cannot
expect
everything
without
some
return
And
I
must
go
into
all
the
circumstances
of
his
life
before
I
can
accept
him
He
must
be
sound
I
must
know
his
heredity
how
his
parents
and
grandparents
died
have
the
strictest
inquiries
made
into
his
private
morals
This
modified
my
secret
congratulations
a
little
And
do
I
understand
said
I
that
I
Yes
he
said
almost
fiercely
You
You
I
answered
never
a
word
My
imagination
was
dancing
wildly
my
innate
scepticism
was
useless
to
modify
its
transports
There
was
not
a
particle
of
gratitude
in
my
mindI
did
not
know
what
to
say
nor
how
to
say
it
But
why
me
in
particular
I
said
at
last
He
had
chanced
to
hear
of
me
from
Professor
Haslar
he
said
as
a
typically
sound
and
sane
young
man
and
he
wished
as
far
as
possible
to
leave
his
money
where
health
and
integrity
were
assured
That
was
my
first
meeting
with
the
little
old
man
He
was
mysterious
about
himself
he
would
not
give
his
name
yet
he
said
and
after
I
had
answered
some
questions
of
his
he
left
me
at
the
Blavitski
portal
I
noticed
that
he
drew
a
handful
of
gold
coins
from
his
pocket
when
it
came
to
paying
for
the
lunch
His
insistence
upon
bodily
health
was
curious
In
accordance
with
an
arrangement
we
had
made
I
applied
that
day
for
a
life
policy
in
the
Loyal
Insurance
Company
for
a
large
sum
and
I
was
exhaustively
overhauled
by
the
medical
advisers
of
that
company
in
the
subsequent
week
Even
that
did
not
satisfy
him
and
he
insisted
I
must
be
reexamined
by
the
great
Doctor
Henderson
It
was
Friday
in
Whitsun
week
before
he
came
to
a
decision
He
called
me
down
quite
late
in
the
eveningnearly
nine
it
wasfrom
cramming
chemical
equations
for
my
Preliminary
Scientific
examination
He
was
standing
in
the
passage
under
the
feeble
gaslamp
and
his
face
was
a
grotesque
interplay
of
shadows
He
seemed
more
bowed
than
when
I
had
first
seen
him
and
his
cheeks
had
sunk
in
a
little
His
voice
shook
with
emotion
Everything
is
satisfactory
Mr
Eden
he
said
Everything
is
quite
quite
satisfactory
And
this
night
of
all
nights
you
must
dine
with
me
and
celebrate
youraccession
He
was
interrupted
by
a
cough
You
wont
have
long
to
wait
either
he
said
wiping
his
handkerchief
across
his
lips
and
gripping
my
hand
with
his
long
bony
claw
that
was
disengaged
Certainly
not
very
long
to
wait
We
went
into
the
street
and
called
a
cab
I
remember
every
incident
of
that
drive
vividly
the
swift
easy
motion
the
vivid
contrast
of
gas
and
oil
and
electric
light
the
crowds
of
people
in
the
streets
the
place
in
Regent
Street
to
which
we
went
and
the
sumptuous
dinner
we
were
served
with
there
I
was
disconcerted
at
first
by
the
welldressed
waiters
glances
at
my
rough
clothes
bothered
by
the
stones
of
the
olives
but
as
the
champagne
warmed
my
blood
my
confidence
revived
At
first
the
old
man
talked
of
himself
He
had
already
told
me
his
name
in
the
cab
he
was
Egbert
Elvesham
the
great
philosopher
whose
name
I
had
known
since
I
was
a
lad
at
school
It
seemed
incredible
to
me
that
this
man
whose
intelligence
had
so
early
dominated
mine
this
great
abstraction
should
suddenly
realise
itself
as
this
decrepit
familiar
figure
I
daresay
every
young
fellow
who
has
suddenly
fallen
among
celebrities
has
felt
something
of
my
disappointment
He
told
me
now
of
the
future
that
the
feeble
streams
of
his
life
would
presently
leave
dry
for
me
houses
copyrights
investments
I
had
never
suspected
that
philosophers
were
so
rich
He
watched
me
drink
and
eat
with
a
touch
of
envy
What
a
capacity
for
living
you
have!
he
said
and
then
with
a
sigh
a
sigh
of
relief
I
could
have
thought
it
It
will
not
be
long
Ay
said
I
my
head
swimming
now
with
champagne
I
have
a
future
perhapsof
a
passing
agreeable
sort
thanks
to
you
I
shall
now
have
the
honour
of
your
name
But
you
have
a
past
Such
a
past
as
is
worth
all
my
future
He
shook
his
head
and
smiled
as
I
thought
with
halfsad
appreciation
of
my
flattering
admiration
That
future
he
said
would
you
in
truth
change
it
The
waiter
came
with
liqueurs
You
will
not
perhaps
mind
taking
my
name
taking
my
position
but
would
you
indeedwillinglytake
my
years
With
your
achievements
said
I
gallantly
He
smiled
again
Kummelboth
he
said
to
the
waiter
and
turned
his
attention
to
a
little
paper
packet
he
had
taken
from
his
pocket
This
hour
said
he
this
afterdinner
hour
is
the
hour
of
small
things
Here
is
a
scrap
of
my
unpublished
wisdom
He
opened
the
packet
with
his
shaking
yellow
fingers
and
showed
a
little
pinkish
powder
on
the
paper
This
said
hewell
you
must
guess
what
it
is
But
Kummelput
but
a
dash
of
this
powder
in
itis
Himmel
His
large
greyish
eyes
watched
mine
with
an
inscrutable
expression
It
was
a
bit
of
a
shock
to
me
to
find
this
great
teacher
gave
his
mind
to
the
flavour
of
liqueurs
However
I
feigned
a
great
interest
in
his
weakness
for
I
was
drunk
enough
for
such
small
sycophancy
He
parted
the
powder
between
the
little
glasses
and
rising
suddenly
with
a
strange
unexpected
dignity
held
out
his
hand
towards
me
I
imitated
his
action
and
the
glasses
rang
To
a
quick
succession
said
he
and
raised
his
glass
towards
his
lips
Not
that
I
said
hastily
Not
that
He
paused
with
the
liqueur
at
the
level
of
his
chin
and
his
eyes
blazing
into
mine
To
a
long
life
said
I
He
hesitated
To
a
long
life
said
he
with
a
sudden
bark
of
laughter
and
with
eyes
fixed
on
one
another
we
tilted
the
little
glasses
His
eyes
looked
straight
into
mine
and
as
I
drained
the
stuff
off
I
felt
a
curiously
intense
sensation
The
first
touch
of
it
set
my
brain
in
a
furious
tumult
I
seemed
to
feel
an
actual
physical
stirring
in
my
skull
and
a
seething
humming
filled
my
ears
I
did
not
notice
the
flavour
in
my
mouth
the
aroma
that
filled
my
throat
I
saw
only
the
grey
intensity
of
his
gaze
that
burnt
into
mine
The
draught
the
mental
confusion
the
noise
and
stirring
in
my
head
seemed
to
last
an
interminable
time
Curious
vague
impressions
of
halfforgotten
things
danced
and
vanished
on
the
edge
of
my
consciousness
At
last
he
broke
the
spell
With
a
sudden
explosive
sigh
he
put
down
his
glass
Well
he
said
Its
glorious
said
I
though
I
had
not
tasted
the
stuff
My
head
was
spinning
I
sat
down
My
brain
was
chaos
Then
my
perception
grew
clear
and
minute
as
though
I
saw
things
in
a
concave
mirror
His
manner
seemed
to
have
changed
into
something
nervous
and
hasty
He
pulled
out
his
watch
and
grimaced
at
it
Elevenseven!
And
tonight
I
mustSeventwentyfive
Waterloo!
I
must
go
at
once
He
called
for
the
bill
and
struggled
with
his
coat
Officious
waiters
came
to
our
assistance
In
another
moment
I
was
wishing
him
goodbye
over
the
apron
of
a
cab
and
still
with
an
absurd
feeling
of
minute
distinctness
as
thoughhow
can
I
express
itI
not
only
saw
but
felt
through
an
inverted
operaglass
That
stuff
he
said
He
put
his
hand
to
his
forehead
I
ought
not
to
have
given
it
to
you
It
will
make
your
head
split
tomorrow
Wait
a
minute
Here
He
handed
me
out
a
little
flat
thing
like
a
seidlitzpowder
Take
that
in
water
as
you
are
going
to
bed
The
other
thing
was
a
drug
Not
till
youre
ready
to
go
to
bed
mind
It
will
clear
your
head
Thats
all
One
more
shakeFuturus!
I
gripped
his
shrivelled
claw
Goodbye
he
said
and
by
the
droop
of
his
eyelids
I
judged
he
too
was
a
little
under
the
influence
of
that
braintwisting
cordial
He
recollected
something
else
with
a
start
felt
in
his
breastpocket
and
produced
another
packet
this
time
a
cylinder
the
size
and
shape
of
a
shavingstick
Here
said
he
Id
almost
forgotten
Dont
open
this
until
I
come
tomorrowbut
take
it
now
It
was
so
heavy
that
I
wellnigh
dropped
it
All
ri!
said
I
and
he
grinned
at
me
through
the
cab
window
as
the
cabman
flicked
his
horse
into
wakefulness
It
was
a
white
packet
he
had
given
me
with
red
seals
at
either
end
and
along
its
edge
If
this
isnt
money
said
I
its
platinum
or
lead
I
stuck
it
with
elaborate
care
into
my
pocket
and
with
a
whirling
brain
walked
home
through
the
Regent
Street
loiterers
and
the
dark
back
streets
beyond
Portland
Road
I
remember
the
sensations
of
that
walk
very
vividly
strange
as
they
were
I
was
still
so
far
myself
that
I
could
notice
my
strange
mental
state
and
wonder
whether
this
stuff
I
had
had
was
opiuma
drug
beyond
my
experience
It
is
hard
now
to
describe
the
peculiarity
of
my
mental
strangenessmental
doubling
vaguely
expresses
it
As
I
was
walking
up
Regent
Street
I
found
in
my
mind
a
queer
persuasion
that
it
was
Waterloo
station
and
had
an
odd
impulse
to
get
into
the
Polytechnic
as
a
man
might
get
into
a
train
I
put
a
knuckle
in
my
eye
and
it
was
Regent
Street
How
can
I
express
it
You
see
a
skilful
actor
looking
quietly
at
you
he
pulls
a
grimace
and
lo!another
person
Is
it
too
extravagant
if
I
tell
you
that
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
Regent
Street
had
for
the
moment
done
that
Then
being
persuaded
it
was
Regent
Street
again
I
was
oddly
muddled
about
some
fantastic
reminiscences
that
cropped
up
Thirty
years
ago
thought
I
it
was
here
that
I
quarrelled
with
my
brother
Then
I
burst
out
laughing
to
the
astonishment
and
encouragement
of
a
group
of
night
prowlers
Thirty
years
ago
I
did
not
exist
and
never
in
my
life
had
I
boasted
a
brother
The
stuff
was
surely
liquid
folly
for
the
poignant
regret
for
that
lost
brother
still
clung
to
me
Along
Portland
Road
the
madness
took
another
turn
I
began
to
recall
vanished
shops
and
to
compare
the
street
with
what
it
used
to
be
Confused
troubled
thinking
is
comprehensible
enough
after
the
drink
I
had
taken
but
what
puzzled
me
were
these
curiously
vivid
phantasm
memories
that
had
crept
into
my
mind
and
not
only
the
memories
that
had
crept
in
but
also
the
memories
that
had
slipped
out
I
stopped
opposite
Stevens
the
natural
history
dealers
and
cudgelled
my
brains
to
think
what
he
had
to
do
with
me
A
bus
went
by
and
sounded
exactly
like
the
rumbling
of
a
train
I
seemed
to
be
dipped
into
some
dark
remote
pit
for
the
recollection
Of
course
said
I
at
last
he
has
promised
me
three
frogs
tomorrow
Odd
I
should
have
forgotten
Do
they
still
show
children
dissolving
views
In
those
I
remember
one
view
would
begin
like
a
faint
ghost
and
grow
and
oust
another
In
just
that
way
it
seemed
to
me
that
a
ghostly
set
of
new
sensations
was
struggling
with
those
of
my
ordinary
self
I
went
on
through
Euston
Road
to
Tottenham
Court
Road
puzzled
and
a
little
frightened
and
scarcely
noticed
the
unusual
way
I
was
taking
for
commonly
I
used
to
cut
through
the
intervening
network
of
back
streets
I
turned
into
University
Street
to
discover
that
I
had
forgotten
my
number
Only
by
a
strong
effort
did
I
recall
A
and
even
then
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
was
a
thing
some
forgotten
person
had
told
me
I
tried
to
steady
my
mind
by
recalling
the
incidents
of
the
dinner
and
for
the
life
of
me
I
could
conjure
up
no
picture
of
my
hosts
face
I
saw
him
only
as
a
shadowy
outline
as
one
might
see
oneself
reflected
in
a
window
through
which
one
was
looking
In
his
place
however
I
had
a
curious
exterior
vision
of
myself
sitting
at
a
table
flushed
brighteyed
and
talkative
I
must
take
this
other
powder
said
I
This
is
getting
impossible
I
tried
the
wrong
side
of
the
hall
for
my
candle
and
the
matches
and
had
a
doubt
of
which
landing
my
room
might
be
on
Im
drunk
I
said
thats
certain
and
blundered
needlessly
on
the
staircase
to
sustain
the
proposition
At
the
first
glance
my
room
seemed
unfamiliar
What
rot!
I
said
and
stared
about
me
I
seemed
to
bring
myself
back
by
the
effort
and
the
odd
phantasmal
quality
passed
into
the
concrete
familiar
There
was
the
old
glass
still
with
my
notes
on
the
albumens
stuck
in
the
corner
of
the
frame
my
old
everyday
suit
of
clothes
pitched
about
the
floor
And
yet
it
was
not
so
real
after
all
I
felt
an
idiotic
persuasion
trying
to
creep
into
my
mind
as
it
were
that
I
was
in
a
railway
carriage
in
a
train
just
stopping
that
I
was
peering
out
of
the
window
at
some
unknown
station
I
gripped
the
bedrail
firmly
to
reassure
myself
Its
clairvoyance
perhaps
I
said
I
must
write
to
the
Psychical
Research
Society
I
put
the
rouleau
on
my
dressingtable
sat
on
my
bed
and
began
to
take
off
my
boots
It
was
as
if
the
picture
of
my
present
sensations
was
painted
over
some
other
picture
that
was
trying
to
show
through
Curse
it!
said
I
my
wits
are
going
or
am
I
in
two
places
at
once
Halfundressed
I
tossed
the
powder
into
a
glass
and
drank
it
off
It
effervesced
and
became
a
fluorescent
amber
colour
Before
I
was
in
bed
my
mind
was
already
tranquillised
I
felt
the
pillow
at
my
cheek
and
thereupon
I
must
have
fallen
asleep





I
awoke
abruptly
out
of
a
dream
of
strange
beasts
and
found
myself
lying
on
my
back
Probably
everyone
knows
that
dismal
emotional
dream
from
which
one
escapes
awake
indeed
but
strangely
cowed
There
was
a
curious
taste
in
my
mouth
a
tired
feeling
in
my
limbs
a
sense
of
cutaneous
discomfort
I
lay
with
my
head
motionless
on
my
pillow
expecting
that
my
feeling
of
strangeness
and
terror
would
probably
pass
away
and
that
I
should
then
doze
off
again
to
sleep
But
instead
of
that
my
uncanny
sensations
increased
At
first
I
could
perceive
nothing
wrong
about
me
There
was
a
faint
light
in
the
room
so
faint
that
it
was
the
very
next
thing
to
darkness
and
the
furniture
stood
out
in
it
as
vague
blots
of
absolute
darkness
I
stared
with
my
eyes
just
over
the
bedclothes
It
came
into
my
mind
that
someone
had
entered
the
room
to
rob
me
of
my
rouleau
of
money
but
after
lying
for
some
moments
breathing
regularly
to
simulate
sleep
I
realised
this
was
mere
fancy
Nevertheless
the
uneasy
assurance
of
something
wrong
kept
fast
hold
of
me
With
an
effort
I
raised
my
head
from
the
pillow
and
peered
about
me
at
the
dark
What
it
was
I
could
not
conceive
I
looked
at
the
dim
shapes
around
me
the
greater
and
lesser
darknesses
that
indicated
curtains
table
fireplace
bookshelves
and
so
forth
Then
I
began
to
perceive
something
unfamiliar
in
the
forms
of
the
darkness
Had
the
bed
turned
round
Yonder
should
be
the
bookshelves
and
something
shrouded
and
pallid
rose
there
something
that
would
not
answer
to
the
bookshelves
however
I
looked
at
it
It
was
far
too
big
to
be
my
shirt
thrown
on
a
chair
Overcoming
a
childish
terror
I
threw
back
the
bedclothes
and
thrust
my
leg
out
of
bed
Instead
of
coming
out
of
my
trucklebed
upon
the
floor
I
found
my
foot
scarcely
reached
the
edge
of
the
mattress
I
made
another
step
as
it
were
and
sat
up
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
By
the
side
of
my
bed
should
be
the
candle
and
the
matches
upon
the
broken
chair
I
put
out
my
hand
and
touchednothing
I
waved
my
hand
in
the
darkness
and
it
came
against
some
heavy
hanging
soft
and
thick
in
texture
which
gave
a
rustling
noise
at
my
touch
I
grasped
this
and
pulled
it
it
appeared
to
be
a
curtain
suspended
over
the
head
of
my
bed
I
was
now
thoroughly
awake
and
beginning
to
realise
that
I
was
in
a
strange
room
I
was
puzzled
I
tried
to
recall
the
overnight
circumstances
and
I
found
them
now
curiously
enough
vivid
in
my
memory
the
supper
my
reception
of
the
little
packages
my
wonder
whether
I
was
intoxicated
my
slow
undressing
the
coolness
to
my
flushed
face
of
my
pillow
I
felt
a
sudden
distrust
Was
that
last
night
or
the
night
before
At
anyrate
this
room
was
strange
to
me
and
I
could
not
imagine
how
I
had
got
into
it
The
dim
pallid
outline
was
growing
paler
and
I
perceived
it
was
a
window
with
the
dark
shape
of
an
oval
toiletglass
against
the
weak
intimation
of
the
dawn
that
filtered
through
the
blind
I
stood
up
and
was
surprised
by
a
curious
feeling
of
weakness
and
unsteadiness
With
trembling
hands
outstretched
I
walked
slowly
towards
the
window
getting
nevertheless
a
bruise
on
the
knee
from
a
chair
by
the
way
I
fumbled
round
the
glass
which
was
large
with
handsome
brass
sconces
to
find
the
blindcord
I
could
not
find
any
By
chance
I
took
hold
of
the
tassel
and
with
the
click
of
a
spring
the
blind
ran
up
I
found
myself
looking
out
upon
a
scene
that
was
altogether
strange
to
me
The
night
was
overcast
and
through
the
flocculent
grey
of
the
heaped
clouds
there
filtered
a
faint
halflight
of
dawn
Just
at
the
edge
of
the
sky
the
cloudcanopy
had
a
bloodred
rim
Below
everything
was
dark
and
indistinct
dim
hills
in
the
distance
a
vague
mass
of
buildings
running
up
into
pinnacles
trees
like
spilt
ink
and
below
the
window
a
tracery
of
black
bushes
and
pale
grey
paths
It
was
so
unfamiliar
that
for
the
moment
I
thought
myself
still
dreaming
I
felt
the
toilettable
it
appeared
to
be
made
of
some
polished
wood
and
was
rather
elaborately
furnishedthere
were
little
cutglass
bottles
and
a
brush
upon
it
There
was
also
a
queer
little
object
horseshoeshaped
it
felt
with
smooth
hard
projections
lying
in
a
saucer
I
could
find
no
matches
nor
candlestick
I
turned
my
eyes
to
the
room
again
Now
the
blind
was
up
faint
spectres
of
its
furnishing
came
out
of
the
darkness
There
was
a
huge
curtained
bed
and
the
fireplace
at
its
foot
had
a
large
white
mantel
with
something
of
the
shimmer
of
marble
I
leant
against
the
toilettable
shut
my
eyes
and
opened
them
again
and
tried
to
think
The
whole
thing
was
far
too
real
for
dreaming
I
was
inclined
to
imagine
there
was
still
some
hiatus
in
my
memory
as
a
consequence
of
my
draught
of
that
strange
liqueur
that
I
had
come
into
my
inheritance
perhaps
and
suddenly
lost
my
recollection
of
everything
since
my
good
fortune
had
been
announced
Perhaps
if
I
waited
a
little
things
would
be
clearer
to
me
again
Yet
my
dinner
with
old
Elvesham
was
now
singularly
vivid
and
recent
The
champagne
the
observant
waiters
the
powder
and
the
liqueursI
could
have
staked
my
soul
it
all
happened
a
few
hours
ago
And
then
occurred
a
thing
so
trivial
and
yet
so
terrible
to
me
that
I
shiver
now
to
think
of
that
moment
I
spoke
aloud
I
said
How
the
devil
did
I
get
here

And
the
voice
was
not
my
own
It
was
not
my
own
it
was
thin
the
articulation
was
slurred
the
resonance
of
my
facial
bones
was
different
Then
to
reassure
myself
I
ran
one
hand
over
the
other
and
felt
loose
folds
of
skin
the
bony
laxity
of
age
Surely
I
said
in
that
horrible
voice
that
had
somehow
established
itself
in
my
throat
surely
this
thing
is
a
dream!
Almost
as
quickly
as
if
I
did
it
involuntarily
I
thrust
my
fingers
into
my
mouth
My
teeth
had
gone
My
fingertips
ran
on
the
flaccid
surface
of
an
even
row
of
shrivelled
gums
I
was
sick
with
dismay
and
disgust
I
felt
then
a
passionate
desire
to
see
myself
to
realise
at
once
in
its
full
horror
the
ghastly
change
that
had
come
upon
me
I
tottered
to
the
mantel
and
felt
along
it
for
matches
As
I
did
so
a
barking
cough
sprang
up
in
my
throat
and
I
clutched
the
thick
flannel
nightdress
I
found
about
me
There
were
no
matches
there
and
I
suddenly
realised
that
my
extremities
were
cold
Sniffing
and
coughing
whimpering
a
little
perhaps
I
fumbled
back
to
bed
It
is
surely
a
dream
I
whimpered
to
myself
as
I
clambered
back
surely
a
dream
It
was
a
senile
repetition
I
pulled
the
bedclothes
over
my
shoulders
over
my
ears
I
thrust
my
withered
hand
under
the
pillow
and
determined
to
compose
myself
to
sleep
Of
course
it
was
a
dream
In
the
morning
the
dream
would
be
over
and
I
should
wake
up
strong
and
vigorous
again
to
my
youth
and
studies
I
shut
my
eyes
breathed
regularly
and
finding
myself
wakeful
began
to
count
slowly
through
the
powers
of
three
But
the
thing
I
desired
would
not
come
I
could
not
get
to
sleep
And
the
persuasion
of
the
inexorable
reality
of
the
change
that
had
happened
to
me
grew
steadily
Presently
I
found
myself
with
my
eyes
wide
open
the
powers
of
three
forgotten
and
my
skinny
fingers
upon
my
shrivelled
gums
I
was
indeed
suddenly
and
abruptly
an
old
man
I
had
in
some
unaccountable
manner
fallen
through
my
life
and
come
to
old
age
in
some
way
I
had
been
cheated
of
all
the
best
of
my
life
of
love
of
struggle
of
strength
and
hope
I
grovelled
into
the
pillow
and
tried
to
persuade
myself
that
such
hallucination
was
possible
Imperceptibly
steadily
the
dawn
grew
clearer
At
last
despairing
of
further
sleep
I
sat
up
in
bed
and
looked
about
me
A
chill
twilight
rendered
the
whole
chamber
visible
It
was
spacious
and
wellfurnished
better
furnished
than
any
room
I
had
ever
slept
in
before
A
candle
and
matches
became
dimly
visible
upon
a
little
pedestal
in
a
recess
I
threw
back
the
bedclothes
and
shivering
with
the
rawness
of
the
early
morning
albeit
it
was
summertime
I
got
out
and
lit
the
candle
Then
trembling
horribly
so
that
the
extinguisher
rattled
on
its
spike
I
tottered
to
the
glass
and
sawElveshams
face!
It
was
none
the
less
horrible
because
I
had
already
dimly
feared
as
much
He
had
already
seemed
physically
weak
and
pitiful
to
me
but
seen
now
dressed
only
in
a
coarse
flannel
nightdress
that
fell
apart
and
showed
the
stringy
neck
seen
now
as
my
own
body
I
cannot
describe
its
desolate
decrepitude
The
hollow
cheeks
the
straggling
tail
of
dirty
grey
hair
the
rheumy
bleared
eyes
the
quivering
shrivelled
lips
the
lower
displaying
a
gleam
of
the
pink
interior
lining
and
those
horrible
dark
gums
showing
You
who
are
mind
and
body
together
at
your
natural
years
cannot
imagine
what
this
fiendish
imprisonment
meant
to
me
To
be
young
and
full
of
the
desire
and
energy
of
youth
and
to
be
caught
and
presently
to
be
crushed
in
this
tottering
ruin
of
a
body
But
I
wander
from
the
course
of
my
story
For
some
time
I
must
have
been
stunned
at
this
change
that
had
come
upon
me
It
was
daylight
when
I
did
so
far
gather
myself
together
as
to
think
In
some
inexplicable
way
I
had
been
changed
though
how
short
of
magic
the
thing
had
been
done
I
could
not
say
And
as
I
thought
the
diabolical
ingenuity
of
Elvesham
came
home
to
me
It
seemed
plain
to
me
that
as
I
found
myself
in
his
so
he
must
be
in
possession
of
my
body
of
my
strength
that
is
and
my
future
But
how
to
prove
it
Then
as
I
thought
the
thing
became
so
incredible
even
to
me
that
my
mind
reeled
and
I
had
to
pinch
myself
to
feel
my
toothless
gums
to
see
myself
in
the
glass
and
touch
the
things
about
me
before
I
could
steady
myself
to
face
the
facts
again
Was
all
life
hallucination
Was
I
indeed
Elvesham
and
he
me
Had
I
been
dreaming
of
Eden
overnight
Was
there
any
Eden
But
if
I
was
Elvesham
I
should
remember
where
I
was
on
the
previous
morning
the
name
of
the
town
in
which
I
lived
what
happened
before
the
dream
began
I
struggled
with
my
thoughts
I
recalled
the
queer
doubleness
of
my
memories
overnight
But
now
my
mind
was
clear
Not
the
ghost
of
any
memories
but
those
proper
to
Eden
could
I
raise
This
way
lies
insanity!
I
cried
in
my
piping
voice
I
staggered
to
my
feet
dragged
my
feeble
heavy
limbs
to
the
washhandstand
and
plunged
my
grey
head
into
a
basin
of
cold
water
Then
towelling
myself
I
tried
again
It
was
no
good
I
felt
beyond
all
question
that
I
was
indeed
Eden
not
Elvesham
But
Eden
in
Elveshams
body!
Had
I
been
a
man
of
any
other
age
I
might
have
given
myself
up
to
my
fate
as
one
enchanted
But
in
these
sceptical
days
miracles
do
not
pass
current
Here
was
some
trick
of
psychology
What
a
drug
and
a
steady
stare
could
do
a
drug
and
a
steady
stare
or
some
similar
treatment
could
surely
undo
Men
have
lost
their
memories
before
But
to
exchange
memories
as
one
does
umbrellas!
I
laughed
Alas!
not
a
healthy
laugh
but
a
wheezing
senile
titter
I
could
have
fancied
old
Elvesham
laughing
at
my
plight
and
a
gust
of
petulant
anger
unusual
to
me
swept
across
my
feelings
I
began
dressing
eagerly
in
the
clothes
I
found
lying
about
on
the
floor
and
only
realised
when
I
was
dressed
that
it
was
an
evening
suit
I
had
assumed
I
opened
the
wardrobe
and
found
some
more
ordinary
clothes
a
pair
of
plaid
trousers
and
an
oldfashioned
dressinggown
I
put
a
venerable
smokingcap
on
my
venerable
head
and
coughing
a
little
from
my
exertions
tottered
out
upon
the
landing
It
was
then
perhaps
a
quarter
to
six
and
the
blinds
were
closely
drawn
and
the
house
quite
silent
The
landing
was
a
spacious
one
a
broad
richlycarpeted
staircase
went
down
into
the
darkness
of
the
hall
below
and
before
me
a
door
ajar
showed
me
a
writingdesk
a
revolving
bookcase
the
back
of
a
study
chair
and
a
fine
array
of
bound
books
shelf
upon
shelf
My
study
I
mumbled
and
walked
across
the
landing
Then
at
the
sound
of
my
voice
a
thought
struck
me
and
I
went
back
to
the
bedroom
and
put
in
the
set
of
false
teeth
They
slipped
in
with
the
ease
of
old
habit
Thats
better
said
I
gnashing
them
and
so
returned
to
the
study
The
drawers
of
the
writingdesk
were
locked
Its
revolving
top
was
also
locked
I
could
see
no
indications
of
the
keys
and
there
were
none
in
the
pockets
of
my
trousers
I
shuffled
back
at
once
to
the
bedroom
and
went
through
the
dress
suit
and
afterwards
the
pockets
of
all
the
garments
I
could
find
I
was
very
eager
and
one
might
have
imagined
that
burglars
had
been
at
work
to
see
my
room
when
I
had
done
Not
only
were
there
no
keys
to
be
found
but
not
a
coin
nor
a
scrap
of
papersave
only
the
receipted
bill
of
the
overnight
dinner
A
curious
weariness
asserted
itself
I
sat
down
and
stared
at
the
garments
flung
here
and
there
their
pockets
turned
inside
out
My
first
frenzy
had
already
flickered
out
Every
moment
I
was
beginning
to
realise
the
immense
intelligence
of
the
plans
of
my
enemy
to
see
more
and
more
clearly
the
hopelessness
of
my
position
With
an
effort
I
rose
and
hurried
hobbling
into
the
study
again
On
the
staircase
was
a
housemaid
pulling
up
the
blinds
She
stared
I
think
at
the
expression
of
my
face
I
shut
the
door
of
the
study
behind
me
and
seizing
a
poker
began
an
attack
upon
the
desk
That
is
how
they
found
me
The
cover
of
the
desk
was
split
the
lock
smashed
the
letters
torn
out
of
the
pigeonholes
and
tossed
about
the
room
In
my
senile
rage
I
had
flung
about
the
pens
and
other
such
light
stationery
and
overturned
the
ink
Moreover
a
large
vase
upon
the
mantel
had
got
brokenI
do
not
know
how
I
could
find
no
chequebook
no
money
no
indications
of
the
slightest
use
for
the
recovery
of
my
body
I
was
battering
madly
at
the
drawers
when
the
butler
backed
by
two
womenservants
intruded
upon
me





That
simply
is
the
story
of
my
change
No
one
will
believe
my
frantic
assertions
I
am
treated
as
one
demented
and
even
at
this
moment
I
am
under
restraint
But
I
am
sane
absolutely
sane
and
to
prove
it
I
have
sat
down
to
write
this
story
minutely
as
the
things
happened
to
me
I
appeal
to
the
reader
whether
there
is
any
trace
of
insanity
in
the
style
or
method
of
the
story
he
has
been
reading
I
am
a
young
man
locked
away
in
an
old
mans
body
But
the
clear
fact
is
incredible
to
everyone
Naturally
I
appear
demented
to
those
who
will
not
believe
this
naturally
I
do
not
know
the
names
of
my
secretaries
of
the
doctors
who
come
to
see
me
of
my
servants
and
neighbours
of
this
town
wherever
it
is
where
I
find
myself
Naturally
I
lose
myself
in
my
own
house
and
suffer
inconveniences
of
every
sort
Naturally
I
ask
the
oddest
questions
Naturally
I
weep
and
cry
out
and
have
paroxysms
of
despair
I
have
no
money
and
no
chequebook
The
bank
will
not
recognise
my
signature
for
I
suppose
that
allowing
for
the
feeble
muscles
I
now
have
my
handwriting
is
still
Edens
These
people
about
me
will
not
let
me
go
to
the
bank
personally
It
seems
indeed
that
there
is
no
bank
in
this
town
and
that
I
have
an
account
in
some
part
of
London
It
seems
that
Elvesham
kept
the
name
of
his
solicitor
secret
from
all
his
householdI
can
ascertain
nothing
Elvesham
was
of
course
a
profound
student
of
mental
science
and
all
my
declarations
of
the
facts
of
the
case
merely
confirm
the
theory
that
my
insanity
is
the
outcome
of
overmuch
brooding
upon
psychology
Dreams
of
the
personal
identity
indeed!
Two
days
ago
I
was
a
healthy
youngster
with
all
life
before
me
now
I
am
a
furious
old
man
unkempt
and
desperate
and
miserable
prowling
about
a
great
luxurious
strange
house
watched
feared
and
avoided
as
a
lunatic
by
everyone
about
me
And
in
London
is
Elvesham
beginning
life
again
in
a
vigorous
body
and
with
all
the
accumulated
knowledge
and
wisdom
of
threescore
and
ten
He
has
stolen
my
life
What
has
happened
I
do
not
clearly
know
In
the
study
are
volumes
of
manuscript
notes
referring
chiefly
to
the
psychology
of
memory
and
parts
of
what
may
be
either
calculations
or
ciphers
in
symbols
absolutely
strange
to
me
In
some
passages
there
are
indications
that
he
was
also
occupied
with
the
philosophy
of
mathematics
I
take
it
he
has
transferred
the
whole
of
his
memories
the
accumulation
that
makes
up
his
personality
from
this
old
withered
brain
of
his
to
mine
and
similarly
that
he
has
transferred
mine
to
his
discarded
tenement
Practically
that
is
he
has
changed
bodies
But
how
such
a
change
may
be
possible
is
without
the
range
of
my
philosophy
I
have
been
a
materialist
for
all
my
thinking
life
but
here
suddenly
is
a
clear
case
of
mans
detachability
from
matter
One
desperate
experiment
I
am
about
to
try
I
sit
writing
here
before
putting
the
matter
to
issue
This
morning
with
the
help
of
a
tableknife
that
I
had
secreted
at
breakfast
I
succeeded
in
breaking
open
a
fairly
obvious
secret
drawer
in
this
wrecked
writingdesk
I
discovered
nothing
save
a
little
green
glass
phial
containing
a
white
powder
Round
the
neck
of
the
phial
was
a
label
and
thereon
was
written
this
one
word
Release
This
may
beis
most
probably
poison
I
can
understand
Elvesham
placing
poison
in
my
way
and
I
should
be
sure
that
it
was
his
intention
so
to
get
rid
of
the
only
living
witness
against
him
were
it
not
for
this
careful
concealment
The
man
has
practically
solved
the
problem
of
immortality
Save
for
the
spite
of
chance
he
will
live
in
my
body
until
it
has
aged
and
then
again
throwing
that
aside
he
will
assume
some
other
victims
youth
and
strength
When
one
remembers
his
heartlessness
it
is
terrible
to
think
of
the
evergrowing
experience
that
How
long
has
he
been
leaping
from
body
to
body
But
I
tire
of
writing
The
powder
appears
to
be
soluble
in
water
The
taste
is
not
unpleasant





There
the
narrative
found
upon
Mr
Elveshams
desk
ends
His
dead
body
lay
between
the
desk
and
the
chair
The
latter
had
been
pushed
back
probably
by
his
last
convulsions
The
story
was
written
in
pencil
and
in
a
crazy
hand
quite
unlike
his
usual
minute
characters
There
remain
only
two
curious
facts
to
record
Indisputably
there
was
some
connection
between
Eden
and
Elvesham
since
the
whole
of
Elveshams
property
was
bequeathed
to
the
young
man
But
he
never
inherited
When
Elvesham
committed
suicide
Eden
was
strangely
enough
already
dead
Twentyfour
hours
before
he
had
been
knocked
down
by
a
cab
and
killed
instantly
at
the
crowded
crossing
at
the
intersection
of
Gower
Street
and
Euston
Road
So
that
the
only
human
being
who
could
have
thrown
light
upon
this
fantastic
narrative
is
beyond
the
reach
of
questions
Without
further
comment
I
leave
this
extraordinary
matter
to
the
readers
individual
judgment
IN
THE
ABYSS
The
lieutenant
stood
in
front
of
the
steel
sphere
and
gnawed
a
piece
of
pine
splinter
What
do
you
think
of
it
Steevens
he
asked
Its
an
idea
said
Steevens
in
the
tone
of
one
who
keeps
an
open
mind
I
believe
it
will
smashflat
said
the
lieutenant
He
seems
to
have
calculated
it
all
out
pretty
well
said
Steevens
still
impartial
But
think
of
the
pressure
said
the
lieutenant
At
the
surface
of
the
water
its
fourteen
pounds
to
the
inch
thirty
feet
down
its
double
that
sixty
treble
ninety
four
times
nine

forty
times
five

three

a
mileits
two
hundred
and
forty
times
fourteen
pounds
thatslets
seethirty
hundredweighta
ton
and
a
half
Steevens
a
ton
and
a
half
to
the
square
inch
And
the
ocean
where
hes
going
is
five
miles
deep
Thats
seven
and
a
half
Sounds
a
lot
said
Steevens
but
its
jolly
thick
steel
The
lieutenant
made
no
answer
but
resumed
his
pine
splinter
The
object
of
their
conversation
was
a
huge
ball
of
steel
having
an
exterior
diameter
of
perhaps
nine
feet
It
looked
like
the
shot
for
some
Titanic
piece
of
artillery
It
was
elaborately
nested
in
a
monstrous
scaffolding
built
into
the
framework
of
the
vessel
and
the
gigantic
spars
that
were
presently
to
sling
it
overboard
gave
the
stern
of
the
ship
an
appearance
that
had
raised
the
curiosity
of
every
decent
sailor
who
had
sighted
it
from
the
Pool
of
London
to
the
Tropic
of
Capricorn
In
two
places
one
above
the
other
the
steel
gave
place
to
a
couple
of
circular
windows
of
enormously
thick
glass
and
one
of
these
set
in
a
steel
frame
of
great
solidity
was
now
partially
unscrewed
Both
the
men
had
seen
the
interior
of
this
globe
for
the
first
time
that
morning
It
was
elaborately
padded
with
air
cushions
with
little
studs
sunk
between
bulging
pillows
to
work
the
simple
mechanism
of
the
affair
Everything
was
elaborately
padded
even
the
Myers
apparatus
which
was
to
absorb
carbonic
acid
and
replace
the
oxygen
inspired
by
its
tenant
when
he
had
crept
in
by
the
glass
manhole
and
had
been
screwed
in
It
was
so
elaborately
padded
that
a
man
might
have
been
fired
from
a
gun
in
it
with
perfect
safety
And
it
had
need
to
be
for
presently
a
man
was
to
crawl
in
through
that
glass
manhole
to
be
screwed
up
tightly
and
to
be
flung
overboard
and
to
sink
downdowndown
for
five
miles
even
as
the
lieutenant
said
It
had
taken
the
strongest
hold
of
his
imagination
it
made
him
a
bore
at
mess
and
he
found
Steevens
the
new
arrival
aboard
a
godsend
to
talk
to
about
it
over
and
over
again
Its
my
opinion
said
the
lieutenant
that
that
glass
will
simply
bend
in
and
bulge
and
smash
under
a
pressure
of
that
sort
Daubr
has
made
rocks
run
like
water
under
big
pressuresand
you
mark
my
words
If
the
glass
did
break
in
said
Steevens
what
then
The
water
would
shoot
in
like
a
jet
of
iron
Have
you
ever
felt
a
straight
jet
of
high
pressure
water
It
would
hit
as
hard
as
a
bullet
It
would
simply
smash
him
and
flatten
him
It
would
tear
down
his
throat
and
into
his
lungs
it
would
blow
in
his
ears
What
a
detailed
imagination
you
have!
protested
Steevens
who
saw
things
vividly
Its
a
simple
statement
of
the
inevitable
said
the
lieutenant
And
the
globe
Would
just
give
out
a
few
little
bubbles
and
it
would
settle
down
comfortably
against
the
day
of
judgment
among
the
oozes
and
the
bottom
claywith
poor
Elstead
spread
over
his
own
smashed
cushions
like
butter
over
bread
He
repeated
this
sentence
as
though
he
liked
it
very
much
Like
butter
over
bread
he
said
Having
a
look
at
the
jigger
said
a
voice
and
Elstead
stood
behind
them
spick
and
span
in
white
with
a
cigarette
between
his
teeth
and
his
eyes
smiling
out
of
the
shadow
of
his
ample
hatbrim
Whats
that
about
bread
and
butter
Weybridge
Grumbling
as
usual
about
the
insufficient
pay
of
naval
officers
It
wont
be
more
than
a
day
now
before
I
start
We
are
to
get
the
slings
ready
today
This
clean
sky
and
gentle
swell
is
just
the
kind
of
thing
for
swinging
off
a
dozen
tons
of
lead
and
iron
isnt
it
It
wont
affect
you
much
said
Weybridge
No
Seventy
or
eighty
feet
down
and
I
shall
be
there
in
a
dozen
seconds
theres
not
a
particle
moving
though
the
wind
shriek
itself
hoarse
up
above
and
the
water
lifts
halfway
to
the
clouds
No
Down
there
He
moved
to
the
side
of
the
ship
and
the
other
two
followed
him
All
three
leant
forward
on
their
elbows
and
stared
down
into
the
yellowgreen
water
Peace
said
Elstead
finishing
his
thought
aloud
Are
you
dead
certain
that
clockwork
will
act
asked
Weybridge
presently
It
has
worked
thirtyfive
times
said
Elstead
Its
bound
to
work
But
if
it
doesnt
Why
shouldnt
it
I
wouldnt
go
down
in
that
confounded
thing
said
Weybridge
for
twenty
thousand
pounds
Cheerful
chap
you
are
said
Elstead
and
spat
sociably
at
a
bubble
below
I
dont
understand
yet
how
you
mean
to
work
the
thing
said
Steevens
In
the
first
place
Im
screwed
into
the
sphere
said
Elstead
and
when
Ive
turned
the
electric
light
off
and
on
three
times
to
show
Im
cheerful
Im
swung
out
over
the
stern
by
that
crane
with
all
those
big
lead
sinkers
slung
below
me
The
top
lead
weight
has
a
roller
carrying
a
hundred
fathoms
of
strong
cord
rolled
up
and
thats
all
that
joins
the
sinkers
to
the
sphere
except
the
slings
that
will
be
cut
when
the
affair
is
dropped
We
use
cord
rather
than
wire
rope
because
its
easier
to
cut
and
more
buoyantnecessary
points
as
you
will
see
Through
each
of
these
lead
weights
you
notice
there
is
a
hole
and
an
iron
rod
will
be
run
through
that
and
will
project
six
feet
on
the
lower
side
If
that
rod
is
rammed
up
from
below
it
knocks
up
a
lever
and
sets
the
clockwork
in
motion
at
the
side
of
the
cylinder
on
which
the
cord
winds
Very
well
The
whole
affair
is
lowered
gently
into
the
water
and
the
slings
are
cut
The
sphere
floatswith
the
air
in
it
its
lighter
than
waterbut
the
lead
weights
go
down
straight
and
the
cord
runs
out
When
the
cord
is
all
paid
out
the
sphere
will
go
down
too
pulled
down
by
the
cord
But
why
the
cord
asked
Steevens
Why
not
fasten
the
weights
directly
to
the
sphere
Because
of
the
smash
down
below
The
whole
affair
will
go
rushing
down
mile
after
mile
at
a
headlong
pace
at
last
It
would
be
knocked
to
pieces
on
the
bottom
if
it
wasnt
for
that
cord
But
the
weights
will
hit
the
bottom
and
directly
they
do
the
buoyancy
of
the
sphere
will
come
into
play
It
will
go
on
sinking
slower
and
slower
come
to
a
stop
at
last
and
then
begin
to
float
upward
again
Thats
where
the
clockwork
comes
in
Directly
the
weights
smash
against
the
sea
bottom
the
rod
will
be
knocked
through
and
will
kick
up
the
clockwork
and
the
cord
will
be
rewound
on
the
reel
I
shall
be
lugged
down
to
the
sea
bottom
There
I
shall
stay
for
half
an
hour
with
the
electric
light
on
looking
about
me
Then
the
clockwork
will
release
a
spring
knife
the
cord
will
be
cut
and
up
I
shall
rush
again
like
a
sodawater
bubble
The
cord
itself
will
help
the
flotation
And
if
you
should
chance
to
hit
a
ship
said
Weybridge
I
should
come
up
at
such
a
pace
I
should
go
clean
through
it
said
Elstead
like
a
cannon
ball
You
neednt
worry
about
that
And
suppose
some
nimble
crustacean
should
wriggle
into
your
clockwork
It
would
be
a
pressing
sort
of
invitation
for
me
to
stop
said
Elstead
turning
his
back
on
the
water
and
staring
at
the
sphere





They
had
swung
Elstead
overboard
by
eleven
oclock
The
day
was
serenely
bright
and
calm
with
the
horizon
lost
in
haze
The
electric
glare
in
the
little
upper
compartment
beamed
cheerfully
three
times
Then
they
let
him
down
slowly
to
the
surface
of
the
water
and
a
sailor
in
the
stern
chains
hung
ready
to
cut
the
tackle
that
held
the
lead
weights
and
the
sphere
together
The
globe
which
had
looked
so
large
on
deck
looked
the
smallest
thing
conceivable
under
the
stern
of
the
ship
It
rolled
a
little
and
its
two
dark
windows
which
floated
uppermost
seemed
like
eyes
turned
up
in
round
wonderment
at
the
people
who
crowded
the
rail
A
voice
wondered
how
Elstead
liked
the
rolling
Are
you
ready
sang
out
the
commander
Ay
ay
sir!
Then
let
her
go!
The
rope
of
the
tackle
tightened
against
the
blade
and
was
cut
and
an
eddy
rolled
over
the
globe
in
a
grotesquely
helpless
fashion
Someone
waved
a
handkerchief
someone
else
tried
an
ineffectual
cheer
a
middy
was
counting
slowly
Eight
nine
ten!
Another
roll
then
with
a
jerk
and
a
splash
the
thing
righted
itself
It
seemed
to
be
stationary
for
a
moment
to
grow
rapidly
smaller
and
then
the
water
closed
over
it
and
it
became
visible
enlarged
by
refraction
and
dimmer
below
the
surface
Before
one
could
count
three
it
had
disappeared
There
was
a
flicker
of
white
light
far
down
in
the
water
that
diminished
to
a
speck
and
vanished
Then
there
was
nothing
but
a
depth
of
water
going
down
into
blackness
through
which
a
shark
was
swimming
Then
suddenly
the
screw
of
the
cruiser
began
to
rotate
the
water
was
crickled
the
shark
disappeared
in
a
wrinkled
confusion
and
a
torrent
of
foam
rushed
across
the
crystalline
clearness
that
had
swallowed
up
Elstead
Whats
the
idee
said
one
AB
to
another
Were
going
to
lay
off
about
a
couple
of
miles
fear
he
should
hit
us
when
he
comes
up
said
his
mate
The
ship
steamed
slowly
to
her
new
position
Aboard
her
almost
everyone
who
was
unoccupied
remained
watching
the
breathing
swell
into
which
the
sphere
had
sunk
For
the
next
halfhour
it
is
doubtful
if
a
word
was
spoken
that
did
not
bear
directly
or
indirectly
on
Elstead
The
December
sun
was
now
high
in
the
sky
and
the
heat
very
considerable
Hell
be
cold
enough
down
there
said
Weybridge
They
say
that
below
a
certain
depth
sea
waters
always
just
about
freezing
Wherell
he
come
up
asked
Steevens
Ive
lost
my
bearings
Thats
the
spot
said
the
commander
who
prided
himself
on
his
omniscience
He
extended
a
precise
finger
southeastward
And
this
I
reckon
is
pretty
nearly
the
moment
he
said
Hes
been
thirtyfive
minutes
How
long
does
it
take
to
reach
the
bottom
of
the
ocean
asked
Steevens
For
a
depth
of
five
miles
and
reckoningas
we
didan
acceleration
of
two
feet
per
second
both
ways
is
just
about
threequarters
of
a
minute
Then
hes
overdue
said
Weybridge
Pretty
nearly
said
the
commander
I
suppose
it
takes
a
few
minutes
for
that
cord
of
his
to
wind
in
I
forgot
that
said
Weybridge
evidently
relieved
And
then
began
the
suspense
A
minute
slowly
dragged
itself
out
and
no
sphere
shot
out
of
the
water
Another
followed
and
nothing
broke
the
low
oily
swell
The
sailors
explained
to
one
another
that
little
point
about
the
windingin
of
the
cord
The
rigging
was
dotted
with
expectant
faces
Come
up
Elstead!
called
one
hairychested
salt
impatiently
and
the
others
caught
it
up
and
shouted
as
though
they
were
waiting
for
the
curtain
of
a
theatre
to
rise
The
commander
glanced
irritably
at
them
Of
course
if
the
accelerations
less
than
two
he
said
hell
be
all
the
longer
We
arent
absolutely
certain
that
was
the
proper
figure
Im
no
slavish
believer
in
calculations
Steevens
agreed
concisely
No
one
on
the
quarterdeck
spoke
for
a
couple
of
minutes
Then
Steevens
watchcase
clicked
When
twentyone
minutes
after
the
sun
reached
the
zenith
they
were
still
waiting
for
the
globe
to
reappear
and
not
a
man
aboard
had
dared
to
whisper
that
hope
was
dead
It
was
Weybridge
who
first
gave
expression
to
that
realisation
He
spoke
while
the
sound
of
eight
bells
still
hung
in
the
air
I
always
distrusted
that
window
he
said
quite
suddenly
to
Steevens
Good
God!
said
Steevens
you
dont
think
Well!
said
Weybridge
and
left
the
rest
to
his
imagination
Im
no
great
believer
in
calculations
myself
said
the
commander
dubiously
so
that
Im
not
altogether
hopeless
yet
And
at
midnight
the
gunboat
was
steaming
slowly
in
a
spiral
round
the
spot
where
the
globe
had
sunk
and
the
white
beam
of
the
electric
light
fled
and
halted
and
swept
discontentedly
onward
again
over
the
waste
of
phosphorescent
waters
under
the
little
stars
If
his
window
hasnt
burst
and
smashed
him
said
Weybridge
then
its
a
cursed
sight
worse
for
his
clockwork
has
gone
wrong
and
hes
alive
now
five
miles
under
our
feet
down
there
in
the
cold
and
dark
anchored
in
that
little
bubble
of
his
where
never
a
ray
of
light
has
shone
or
a
human
being
lived
since
the
waters
were
gathered
together
Hes
there
without
food
feeling
hungry
and
thirsty
and
scared
wondering
whether
hell
starve
or
stifle
Which
will
it
be
The
Myers
apparatus
is
running
out
I
suppose
How
long
do
they
last
Good
heavens!
he
exclaimed
what
little
things
we
are!
What
daring
little
devils!
Down
there
miles
and
miles
of
waterall
water
and
all
this
empty
water
about
us
and
this
sky
Gulfs!
He
threw
his
hands
out
and
as
he
did
so
a
little
white
streak
swept
noiselessly
up
the
sky
travelled
more
slowly
stopped
became
a
motionless
dot
as
though
a
new
star
had
fallen
up
into
the
sky
Then
it
went
sliding
back
again
and
lost
itself
amidst
the
reflections
of
the
stars
and
the
white
haze
of
the
seas
phosphorescence
At
the
sight
he
stopped
arm
extended
and
mouth
open
He
shut
his
mouth
opened
it
again
and
waved
his
arms
with
an
impatient
gesture
Then
he
turned
shouted
Elstead
ahoy!
to
the
first
watch
and
went
at
a
run
to
Lindley
and
the
searchlight
I
saw
him
he
said
Starboard
there!
His
lights
on
and
hes
just
shot
out
of
the
water
Bring
the
light
round
We
ought
to
see
him
drifting
when
he
lifts
on
the
swell
But
they
never
picked
up
the
explorer
until
dawn
Then
they
almost
ran
him
down
The
crane
was
swung
out
and
a
boats
crew
hooked
the
chain
to
the
sphere
When
they
had
shipped
the
sphere
they
unscrewed
the
manhole
and
peered
into
the
darkness
of
the
interior
for
the
electric
light
chamber
was
intended
to
illuminate
the
water
about
the
sphere
and
was
shut
off
entirely
from
its
general
cavity
The
air
was
very
hot
within
the
cavity
and
the
indiarubber
at
the
lip
of
the
manhole
was
soft
There
was
no
answer
to
their
eager
questions
and
no
sound
of
movement
within
Elstead
seemed
to
be
lying
motionless
crumpled
up
in
the
bottom
of
the
globe
The
ships
doctor
crawled
in
and
lifted
him
out
to
the
men
outside
For
a
moment
or
so
they
did
not
know
whether
Elstead
was
alive
or
dead
His
face
in
the
yellow
light
of
the
ships
lamps
glistened
with
perspiration
They
carried
him
down
to
his
own
cabin
He
was
not
dead
they
found
but
in
a
state
of
absolute
nervous
collapse
and
besides
cruelly
bruised
For
some
days
he
had
to
lie
perfectly
still
It
was
a
week
before
he
could
tell
his
experiences
Almost
his
first
words
were
that
he
was
going
down
again
The
sphere
would
have
to
be
altered
he
said
in
order
to
allow
him
to
throw
off
the
cord
if
need
be
and
that
was
all
He
had
had
the
most
marvellous
experience
You
thought
I
should
find
nothing
but
ooze
he
said
You
laughed
at
my
explorations
and
Ive
discovered
a
new
world!
He
told
his
story
in
disconnected
fragments
and
chiefly
from
the
wrong
end
so
that
it
is
impossible
to
retell
it
in
his
words
But
what
follows
is
the
narrative
of
his
experience
It
began
atrociously
he
said
Before
the
cord
ran
out
the
thing
kept
rolling
over
He
felt
like
a
frog
in
a
football
He
could
see
nothing
but
the
crane
and
the
sky
overhead
with
an
occasional
glimpse
of
the
people
on
the
ships
rail
He
couldnt
tell
a
bit
which
way
the
thing
would
roll
next
Suddenly
he
would
find
his
feet
going
up
and
try
to
step
and
over
he
went
rolling
head
over
heels
and
just
anyhow
on
the
padding
Any
other
shape
would
have
been
more
comfortable
but
no
other
shape
was
to
be
relied
upon
under
the
huge
pressure
of
the
nethermost
abyss
Suddenly
the
swaying
ceased
the
globe
righted
and
when
he
had
picked
himself
up
he
saw
the
water
all
about
him
greenyblue
with
an
attenuated
light
filtering
down
from
above
and
a
shoal
of
little
floating
things
went
rushing
up
past
him
as
it
seemed
to
him
towards
the
light
And
even
as
he
looked
it
grew
darker
and
darker
until
the
water
above
was
as
dark
as
the
midnight
sky
albeit
of
a
greener
shade
and
the
water
below
black
And
little
transparent
things
in
the
water
developed
a
faint
glint
of
luminosity
and
shot
past
him
in
faint
greenish
streaks
And
the
feeling
of
falling!
It
was
just
like
the
start
of
a
lift
he
said
only
it
kept
on
One
has
to
imagine
what
that
means
that
keeping
on
It
was
then
of
all
times
that
Elstead
repented
of
his
adventure
He
saw
the
chances
against
him
in
an
altogether
new
light
He
thought
of
the
big
cuttlefish
people
knew
to
exist
in
the
middle
waters
the
kind
of
things
they
find
half
digested
in
whales
at
times
or
floating
dead
and
rotten
and
half
eaten
by
fish
Suppose
one
caught
hold
and
wouldnt
let
go
And
had
the
clockwork
really
been
sufficiently
tested
But
whether
he
wanted
to
go
on
or
to
go
back
mattered
not
the
slightest
now
In
fifty
seconds
everything
was
as
black
as
night
outside
except
where
the
beam
from
his
light
struck
through
the
waters
and
picked
out
every
now
and
then
some
fish
or
scrap
of
sinking
matter
They
flashed
by
too
fast
for
him
to
see
what
they
were
Once
he
thinks
he
passed
a
shark
And
then
the
sphere
began
to
get
hot
by
friction
against
the
water
They
had
underestimated
this
it
seems
The
first
thing
he
noticed
was
that
he
was
perspiring
and
then
he
heard
a
hissing
growing
louder
under
his
feet
and
saw
a
lot
of
little
bubblesvery
little
bubbles
they
wererushing
upward
like
a
fan
through
the
water
outside
Steam!
He
felt
the
window
and
it
was
hot
He
turned
on
the
minute
glowlamp
that
lit
his
own
cavity
looked
at
the
padded
watch
by
the
studs
and
saw
he
had
been
travelling
now
for
two
minutes
It
came
into
his
head
that
the
window
would
crack
through
the
conflict
of
temperatures
for
he
knew
the
bottom
water
is
very
near
freezing
Then
suddenly
the
floor
of
the
sphere
seemed
to
press
against
his
feet
the
rush
of
bubbles
outside
grew
slower
and
slower
and
the
hissing
diminished
The
sphere
rolled
a
little
The
window
had
not
cracked
nothing
had
given
and
he
knew
that
the
dangers
of
sinking
at
anyrate
were
over
In
another
minute
or
so
he
would
be
on
the
floor
of
the
abyss
He
thought
he
said
of
Steevens
and
Weybridge
and
the
rest
of
them
five
miles
overhead
higher
to
him
than
the
very
highest
clouds
that
ever
floated
over
land
are
to
us
steaming
slowly
and
staring
down
and
wondering
what
had
happened
to
him
He
peered
out
of
the
window
There
were
no
more
bubbles
now
and
the
hissing
had
stopped
Outside
there
was
a
heavy
blacknessas
black
as
black
velvetexcept
where
the
electric
light
pierced
the
empty
water
and
showed
the
colour
of
ita
yellowgreen
Then
three
things
like
shapes
of
fire
swam
into
sight
following
each
other
through
the
water
Whether
they
were
little
and
near
or
big
and
far
off
he
could
not
tell
Each
was
outlined
in
a
bluish
light
almost
as
bright
as
the
lights
of
a
fishing
smack
a
light
which
seemed
to
be
smoking
greatly
and
all
along
the
sides
of
them
were
specks
of
this
like
the
lighter
portholes
of
a
ship
Their
phosphorescence
seemed
to
go
out
as
they
came
into
the
radiance
of
his
lamp
and
he
saw
then
that
they
were
little
fish
of
some
strange
sort
with
huge
heads
vast
eyes
and
dwindling
bodies
and
tails
Their
eyes
were
turned
towards
him
and
he
judged
they
were
following
him
down
He
supposed
they
were
attracted
by
his
glare
Presently
others
of
the
same
sort
joined
them
As
he
went
on
down
he
noticed
that
the
water
became
of
a
pallid
colour
and
that
little
specks
twinkled
in
his
ray
like
motes
in
a
sunbeam
This
was
probably
due
to
the
clouds
of
ooze
and
mud
that
the
impact
of
his
leaden
sinkers
had
disturbed
By
the
time
he
was
drawn
down
to
the
lead
weights
he
was
in
a
dense
fog
of
white
that
his
electric
light
failed
altogether
to
pierce
for
more
than
a
few
yards
and
many
minutes
elapsed
before
the
hanging
sheets
of
sediment
subsided
to
any
extent
Then
lit
by
his
light
and
by
the
transient
phosphorescence
of
a
distant
shoal
of
fishes
he
was
able
to
see
under
the
huge
blackness
of
the
superincumbent
water
an
undulating
expanse
of
greyishwhite
ooze
broken
here
and
there
by
tangled
thickets
of
a
growth
of
sea
lilies
waving
hungry
tentacles
in
the
air
Farther
away
were
the
graceful
translucent
outlines
of
a
group
of
gigantic
sponges
About
this
floor
there
were
scattered
a
number
of
bristling
flattish
tufts
of
rich
purple
and
black
which
he
decided
must
be
some
sort
of
seaurchin
and
small
largeeyed
or
blind
things
having
a
curious
resemblance
some
to
woodlice
and
others
to
lobsters
crawled
sluggishly
across
the
track
of
the
light
and
vanished
into
the
obscurity
again
leaving
furrowed
trails
behind
them
Then
suddenly
the
hovering
swarm
of
little
fishes
veered
about
and
came
towards
him
as
a
flight
of
starlings
might
do
They
passed
over
him
like
a
phosphorescent
snow
and
then
he
saw
behind
them
some
larger
creature
advancing
towards
the
sphere
At
first
he
could
see
it
only
dimly
a
faintly
moving
figure
remotely
suggestive
of
a
walking
man
and
then
it
came
into
the
spray
of
light
that
the
lamp
shot
out
As
the
glare
struck
it
it
shut
its
eyes
dazzled
He
stared
in
rigid
astonishment
It
was
a
strange
vertebrated
animal
Its
dark
purple
head
was
dimly
suggestive
of
a
chameleon
but
it
had
such
a
high
forehead
and
such
a
braincase
as
no
reptile
ever
displayed
before
the
vertical
pitch
of
its
face
gave
it
a
most
extraordinary
resemblance
to
a
human
being
Two
large
and
protruding
eyes
projected
from
sockets
in
chameleon
fashion
and
it
had
a
broad
reptilian
mouth
with
horny
lips
beneath
its
little
nostrils
In
the
position
of
the
ears
were
two
huge
gillcovers
and
out
of
these
floated
a
branching
tree
of
coralline
filaments
almost
like
the
treelike
gills
that
very
young
rays
and
sharks
possess
But
the
humanity
of
the
face
was
not
the
most
extraordinary
thing
about
the
creature
It
was
a
biped
its
almost
globular
body
was
poised
on
a
tripod
of
two
froglike
legs
and
a
long
thick
tail
and
its
fore
limbs
which
grotesquely
caricatured
the
human
hand
much
as
a
frogs
do
carried
a
long
shaft
of
bone
tipped
with
copper
The
colour
of
the
creature
was
variegated
its
head
hands
and
legs
were
purple
but
its
skin
which
hung
loosely
upon
it
even
as
clothes
might
do
was
a
phosphorescent
grey
And
it
stood
there
blinded
by
the
light
At
last
this
unknown
creature
of
the
abyss
blinked
its
eyes
open
and
shading
them
with
its
disengaged
hand
opened
its
mouth
and
gave
vent
to
a
shouting
noise
articulate
almost
as
speech
might
be
that
penetrated
even
the
steel
case
and
padded
jacket
of
the
sphere
How
a
shouting
may
be
accomplished
without
lungs
Elstead
does
not
profess
to
explain
It
then
moved
sideways
out
of
the
glare
into
the
mystery
of
shadow
that
bordered
it
on
either
side
and
Elstead
felt
rather
than
saw
that
it
was
coming
towards
him
Fancying
the
light
had
attracted
it
he
turned
the
switch
that
cut
off
the
current
In
another
moment
something
soft
dabbed
upon
the
steel
and
the
globe
swayed
Then
the
shouting
was
repeated
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
a
distant
echo
answered
it
The
dabbing
recurred
and
the
globe
swayed
and
ground
against
the
spindle
over
which
the
wire
was
rolled
He
stood
in
the
blackness
and
peered
out
into
the
everlasting
night
of
the
abyss
And
presently
he
saw
very
faint
and
remote
other
phosphorescent
quasihuman
forms
hurrying
towards
him
Hardly
knowing
what
he
did
he
felt
about
in
his
swaying
prison
for
the
stud
of
the
exterior
electric
light
and
came
by
accident
against
his
own
small
glowlamp
in
its
padded
recess
The
sphere
twisted
and
then
threw
him
down
he
heard
shouts
like
shouts
of
surprise
and
when
he
rose
to
his
feet
he
saw
two
pairs
of
stalked
eyes
peering
into
the
lower
window
and
reflecting
his
light
In
another
moment
hands
were
dabbing
vigorously
at
his
steel
casing
and
there
was
a
sound
horrible
enough
in
his
position
of
the
metal
protection
of
the
clockwork
being
vigorously
hammered
That
indeed
sent
his
heart
into
his
mouth
for
if
these
strange
creatures
succeeded
in
stopping
that
his
release
would
never
occur
Scarcely
had
he
thought
as
much
when
he
felt
the
sphere
sway
violently
and
the
floor
of
it
press
hard
against
his
feet
He
turned
off
the
small
glowlamp
that
lit
the
interior
and
sent
the
ray
of
the
large
light
in
the
separate
compartment
out
into
the
water
The
seafloor
and
the
manlike
creatures
had
disappeared
and
a
couple
of
fish
chasing
each
other
dropped
suddenly
by
the
window
He
thought
at
once
that
these
strange
denizens
of
the
deep
sea
had
broken
the
rope
and
that
he
had
escaped
He
drove
up
faster
and
faster
and
then
stopped
with
a
jerk
that
sent
him
flying
against
the
padded
roof
of
his
prison
For
half
a
minute
perhaps
he
was
too
astonished
to
think
Then
he
felt
that
the
sphere
was
spinning
slowly
and
rocking
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
was
also
being
drawn
through
the
water
By
crouching
close
to
the
window
he
managed
to
make
his
weight
effective
and
roll
that
part
of
the
sphere
downward
but
he
could
see
nothing
save
the
pale
ray
of
his
light
striking
down
ineffectively
into
the
darkness
It
occurred
to
him
that
he
would
see
more
if
he
turned
the
lamp
off
and
allowed
his
eyes
to
grow
accustomed
to
the
profound
obscurity
In
this
he
was
wise
After
some
minutes
the
velvety
blackness
became
a
translucent
blackness
and
then
far
away
and
as
faint
as
the
zodiacal
light
of
an
English
summer
evening
he
saw
shapes
moving
below
He
judged
these
creatures
had
detached
his
cable
and
were
towing
him
along
the
sea
bottom
And
then
he
saw
something
faint
and
remote
across
the
undulations
of
the
submarine
plain
a
broad
horizon
of
pale
luminosity
that
extended
this
way
and
that
way
as
far
as
the
range
of
his
little
window
permitted
him
to
see
To
this
he
was
being
towed
as
a
balloon
might
be
towed
by
men
out
of
the
open
country
into
a
town
He
approached
it
very
slowly
and
very
slowly
the
dim
irradiation
was
gathered
together
into
more
definite
shapes
It
was
nearly
five
oclock
before
he
came
over
this
luminous
area
and
by
that
time
he
could
make
out
an
arrangement
suggestive
of
streets
and
houses
grouped
about
a
vast
roofless
erection
that
was
grotesquely
suggestive
of
a
ruined
abbey
It
was
spread
out
like
a
map
below
him
The
houses
were
all
roofless
enclosures
of
walls
and
their
substance
being
as
he
afterwards
saw
of
phosphorescent
bones
gave
the
place
an
appearance
as
if
it
were
built
of
drowned
moonshine
Among
the
inner
caves
of
the
place
waving
trees
of
crinoid
stretched
their
tentacles
and
tall
slender
glassy
sponges
shot
like
shining
minarets
and
lilies
of
filmy
light
out
of
the
general
glow
of
the
city
In
the
open
spaces
of
the
place
he
could
see
a
stirring
movement
as
of
crowds
of
people
but
he
was
too
many
fathoms
above
them
to
distinguish
the
individuals
in
those
crowds
Then
slowly
they
pulled
him
down
and
as
they
did
so
the
details
of
the
place
crept
slowly
upon
his
apprehension
He
saw
that
the
courses
of
the
cloudy
buildings
were
marked
out
with
beaded
lines
of
round
objects
and
then
he
perceived
that
at
several
points
below
him
in
broad
open
spaces
were
forms
like
the
encrusted
shapes
of
ships
Slowly
and
surely
he
was
drawn
down
and
the
forms
below
him
became
brighter
clearer
more
distinct
He
was
being
pulled
down
he
perceived
towards
the
large
building
in
the
centre
of
the
town
and
he
could
catch
a
glimpse
ever
and
again
of
the
multitudinous
forms
that
were
lugging
at
his
cord
He
was
astonished
to
see
that
the
rigging
of
one
of
the
ships
which
formed
such
a
prominent
feature
of
the
place
was
crowded
with
a
host
of
gesticulating
figures
regarding
him
and
then
the
walls
of
the
great
building
rose
about
him
silently
and
hid
the
city
from
his
eyes
And
such
walls
they
were
of
waterlogged
wood
and
twisted
wirerope
and
iron
spars
and
copper
and
the
bones
and
skulls
of
dead
men
The
skulls
ran
in
zigzag
lines
and
spirals
and
fantastic
curves
over
the
building
and
in
and
out
of
their
eyesockets
and
over
the
whole
surface
of
the
place
lurked
and
played
a
multitude
of
silvery
little
fishes
Suddenly
his
ears
were
filled
with
a
low
shouting
and
a
noise
like
the
violent
blowing
of
horns
and
this
gave
place
to
a
fantastic
chant
Down
the
sphere
sank
past
the
huge
pointed
windows
through
which
he
saw
vaguely
a
great
number
of
these
strange
ghostlike
people
regarding
him
and
at
last
he
came
to
rest
as
it
seemed
on
a
kind
of
altar
that
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
place
And
now
he
was
at
such
a
level
that
he
could
see
these
strange
people
of
the
abyss
plainly
once
more
To
his
astonishment
he
perceived
that
they
were
prostrating
themselves
before
him
all
save
one
dressed
as
it
seemed
in
a
robe
of
placoid
scales
and
crowned
with
a
luminous
diadem
who
stood
with
his
reptilian
mouth
opening
and
shutting
as
though
he
led
the
chanting
of
the
worshippers
A
curious
impulse
made
Elstead
turn
on
his
small
glowlamp
again
so
that
he
became
visible
to
these
creatures
of
the
abyss
albeit
the
glare
made
them
disappear
forthwith
into
night
At
this
sudden
sight
of
him
the
chanting
gave
place
to
a
tumult
of
exultant
shouts
and
Elstead
being
anxious
to
watch
them
turned
his
light
off
again
and
vanished
from
before
their
eyes
But
for
a
time
he
was
too
blind
to
make
out
what
they
were
doing
and
when
at
last
he
could
distinguish
them
they
were
kneeling
again
And
thus
they
continued
worshipping
him
without
rest
or
intermission
for
the
space
of
three
hours
Most
circumstantial
was
Elsteads
account
of
this
astounding
city
and
its
people
these
people
of
perpetual
night
who
have
never
seen
sun
or
moon
or
stars
green
vegetation
nor
any
living
airbreathing
creatures
who
know
nothing
of
fire
nor
any
light
but
the
phosphorescent
light
of
living
things
Startling
as
is
his
story
it
is
yet
more
startling
to
find
that
scientific
men
of
such
eminence
as
Adams
and
Jenkins
find
nothing
incredible
in
it
They
tell
me
they
see
no
reason
why
intelligent
waterbreathing
vertebrated
creatures
inured
to
a
low
temperature
and
enormous
pressure
and
of
such
a
heavy
structure
that
neither
alive
nor
dead
would
they
float
might
not
live
upon
the
bottom
of
the
deep
sea
and
quite
unsuspected
by
us
descendants
like
ourselves
of
the
great
Theriomorpha
of
the
New
Red
Sandstone
age
We
should
be
known
to
them
however
as
strange
meteoric
creatures
wont
to
fall
catastrophically
dead
out
of
the
mysterious
blackness
of
their
watery
sky
And
not
only
we
ourselves
but
our
ships
our
metals
our
appliances
would
come
raining
down
out
of
the
night
Sometimes
sinking
things
would
smite
down
and
crush
them
as
if
it
were
the
judgment
of
some
unseen
power
above
and
sometimes
would
come
things
of
the
utmost
rarity
or
utility
or
shapes
of
inspiring
suggestion
One
can
understand
perhaps
something
of
their
behaviour
at
the
descent
of
a
living
man
if
one
thinks
what
a
barbaric
people
might
do
to
whom
an
enhaloed
shining
creature
came
suddenly
out
of
the
sky
At
one
time
or
another
Elstead
probably
told
the
officers
of
the
Ptarmigan
every
detail
of
his
strange
twelve
hours
in
the
abyss
That
he
also
intended
to
write
them
down
is
certain
but
he
never
did
and
so
unhappily
we
have
to
piece
together
the
discrepant
fragments
of
his
story
from
the
reminiscences
of
Commander
Simmons
Weybridge
Steevens
Lindley
and
the
others
We
see
the
thing
darkly
in
fragmentary
glimpsesthe
huge
ghostly
building
the
bowing
chanting
people
with
their
dark
chameleonlike
heads
and
faintly
luminous
clothing
and
Elstead
with
his
light
turned
on
again
vainly
trying
to
convey
to
their
minds
that
the
cord
by
which
the
sphere
was
held
was
to
be
severed
Minute
after
minute
slipped
away
and
Elstead
looking
at
his
watch
was
horrified
to
find
that
he
had
oxygen
only
for
four
hours
more
But
the
chant
in
his
honour
kept
on
as
remorselessly
as
if
it
was
the
marching
song
of
his
approaching
death
The
manner
of
his
release
he
does
not
understand
but
to
judge
by
the
end
of
cord
that
hung
from
the
sphere
it
had
been
cut
through
by
rubbing
against
the
edge
of
the
altar
Abruptly
the
sphere
rolled
over
and
he
swept
up
out
of
their
world
as
an
ethereal
creature
clothed
in
a
vacuum
would
sweep
through
our
own
atmosphere
back
to
its
native
ether
again
He
must
have
torn
out
of
their
sight
as
a
hydrogen
bubble
hastens
upward
from
our
air
A
strange
ascension
it
must
have
seemed
to
them
The
sphere
rushed
up
with
even
greater
velocity
than
when
weighted
with
the
lead
sinkers
it
had
rushed
down
It
became
exceedingly
hot
It
drove
up
with
the
windows
uppermost
and
he
remembers
the
torrent
of
bubbles
frothing
against
the
glass
Every
moment
he
expected
this
to
fly
Then
suddenly
something
like
a
huge
wheel
seemed
to
be
released
in
his
head
the
padded
compartment
began
spinning
about
him
and
he
fainted
His
next
recollection
was
of
his
cabin
and
of
the
doctors
voice
But
that
is
the
substance
of
the
extraordinary
story
that
Elstead
related
in
fragments
to
the
officers
of
the
Ptarmigan
He
promised
to
write
it
all
down
at
a
later
date
His
mind
was
chiefly
occupied
with
the
improvement
of
his
apparatus
which
was
effected
at
Rio
It
remains
only
to
tell
that
on
February


he
made
his
second
descent
into
the
ocean
abyss
with
the
improvements
his
first
experience
suggested
What
happened
we
shall
probably
never
know
He
never
returned
The
Ptarmigan
beat
about
over
the
point
of
his
submersion
seeking
him
in
vain
for
thirteen
days
Then
she
returned
to
Rio
and
the
news
was
telegraphed
to
his
friends
So
the
matter
remains
for
the
present
But
it
is
hardly
probable
that
no
further
attempt
will
be
made
to
verify
his
strange
story
of
these
hitherto
unsuspected
cities
of
the
deep
sea
THE
APPLE
I
must
get
rid
of
it
said
the
man
in
the
corner
of
the
carriage
abruptly
breaking
the
silence
Mr
Hinchcliff
looked
up
hearing
imperfectly
He
had
been
lost
in
the
rapt
contemplation
of
the
college
cap
tied
by
a
string
to
his
portmanteau
handlesthe
outward
and
visible
sign
of
his
newlygained
pedagogic
positionin
the
rapt
appreciation
of
the
college
cap
and
the
pleasant
anticipations
it
excited
For
Mr
Hinchcliff
had
just
matriculated
at
London
University
and
was
going
to
be
junior
assistant
at
the
Holmwood
Grammar
Schoola
very
enviable
position
He
stared
across
the
carriage
at
his
fellowtraveller
Why
not
give
it
away
said
this
person
Give
it
away!
Why
not
He
was
a
tall
dark
sunburnt
man
with
a
pale
face
His
arms
were
folded
tightly
and
his
feet
were
on
the
seat
in
front
of
him
He
was
pulling
at
a
lank
black
moustache
He
stared
hard
at
his
toes
Why
not
he
said
Mr
Hinchcliff
coughed
The
stranger
lifted
his
eyesthey
were
curious
darkgrey
eyesand
stared
blankly
at
Mr
Hinchcliff
for
the
best
part
of
a
minute
perhaps
His
expression
grew
to
interest
Yes
he
said
slowly
Why
not
And
end
it
I
dont
quite
follow
you
Im
afraid
said
Mr
Hinchcliff
with
another
cough
You
dont
quite
follow
me
said
the
stranger
quite
mechanically
his
singular
eyes
wandering
from
Mr
Hinchcliff
to
the
bag
with
its
ostentatiously
displayed
cap
and
back
to
Mr
Hinchcliffs
downy
face
Youre
so
abrupt
you
know
apologised
Mr
Hinchcliff
Why
shouldnt
I
said
the
stranger
following
his
thoughts
You
are
a
student
he
said
addressing
Mr
Hinchcliff
I
amby
Correspondenceof
the
London
University
said
Mr
Hinchcliff
with
irrepressible
pride
and
feeling
nervously
at
his
tie
In
pursuit
of
knowledge
said
the
stranger
and
suddenly
took
his
feet
off
the
seat
put
his
fist
on
his
knees
and
stared
at
Mr
Hinchcliff
as
though
he
had
never
seen
a
student
before
Yes
he
said
and
flung
out
an
index
finger
Then
he
rose
took
a
bag
from
the
hatrack
and
unlocked
it
Quite
silently
he
drew
out
something
round
and
wrapped
in
a
quantity
of
silverpaper
and
unfolded
this
carefully
He
held
it
out
towards
Mr
Hinchcliffa
small
very
smooth
goldenyellow
fruit
Mr
Hinchcliffs
eyes
and
mouth
were
open
He
did
not
offer
to
take
this
objectif
he
was
intended
to
take
it
That
said
this
fantastic
stranger
speaking
very
slowly
is
the
Apple
of
the
Tree
of
Knowledge
Look
at
itsmall
and
bright
and
wonderfulKnowledgeand
I
am
going
to
give
it
to
you
Mr
Hinchcliffs
mind
worked
painfully
for
a
minute
and
then
the
sufficient
explanation
Mad!
flashed
across
his
brain
and
illuminated
the
whole
situation
One
humoured
madmen
He
put
his
head
a
little
on
one
side
The
Apple
of
the
Tree
of
Knowledge
eigh!
said
Mr
Hinchcliff
regarding
it
with
a
finely
assumed
air
of
interest
and
then
looking
at
the
interlocutor
But
dont
you
want
to
eat
it
yourself
And
besideshow
did
you
come
by
it
It
never
fades
I
have
had
it
now
three
months
And
it
is
ever
bright
and
smooth
and
ripe
and
desirable
as
you
see
it
He
laid
his
hand
on
his
knee
and
regarded
the
fruit
musingly
Then
he
began
to
wrap
it
again
in
the
papers
as
though
he
had
abandoned
his
intention
of
giving
it
away
But
how
did
you
come
by
it
said
Mr
Hinchcliff
who
had
his
argumentative
side
And
how
do
you
know
that
it
is
the
Fruit
of
the
Tree
I
bought
this
fruit
said
the
stranger
three
months
agofor
a
drink
of
water
and
a
crust
of
bread
The
man
who
gave
it
to
mebecause
I
kept
the
life
in
himwas
an
Armenian
Armenia!
that
wonderful
country
the
first
of
all
countries
where
the
ark
of
the
Flood
remains
to
this
day
buried
in
the
glaciers
of
Mount
Ararat
This
man
I
say
fleeing
with
others
from
the
Kurds
who
had
come
upon
them
went
up
into
desolate
places
among
the
mountainsplaces
beyond
the
common
knowledge
of
men
And
fleeing
from
imminent
pursuit
they
came
to
a
slope
high
among
the
mountainpeaks
green
with
a
grass
like
knifeblades
that
cut
and
slashed
most
pitilessly
at
anyone
who
went
into
it
The
Kurds
were
close
behind
and
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
plunge
in
and
the
worst
of
it
was
that
the
paths
they
made
through
it
at
the
price
of
their
blood
served
for
the
Kurds
to
follow
Every
one
of
the
fugitives
was
killed
save
this
Armenian
and
another
He
heard
the
screams
and
cries
of
his
friends
and
the
swish
of
the
grass
about
those
who
were
pursuing
themit
was
tall
grass
rising
overhead
And
then
a
shouting
and
answers
and
when
presently
he
paused
everything
was
still
He
pushed
out
again
not
understanding
cut
and
bleeding
until
he
came
out
on
a
steep
slope
of
rocks
below
a
precipice
and
then
he
saw
the
grass
was
all
on
fire
and
the
smoke
of
it
rose
like
a
veil
between
him
and
his
enemies
The
stranger
paused
Yes
said
Mr
Hinchcliff
Yes
There
he
was
all
torn
and
bloody
from
the
knifeblades
of
the
grass
the
rocks
blazing
under
the
afternoon
sunthe
sky
molten
brassand
the
smoke
of
the
fire
driving
towards
him
He
dared
not
stay
there
Death
he
did
not
mind
but
torture!
Far
away
beyond
the
smoke
he
heard
shouts
and
cries
Women
screaming
So
he
went
clambering
up
a
gorge
in
the
rockseverywhere
were
bushes
with
dry
branches
that
stuck
out
like
thorns
among
the
leavesuntil
he
clambered
over
the
brow
of
a
ridge
that
hid
him
And
then
he
met
his
companion
a
shepherd
who
had
also
escaped
And
counting
cold
and
famine
and
thirst
as
nothing
against
the
Kurds
they
went
on
into
the
heights
and
among
the
snow
and
ice
They
wandered
three
whole
days
The
third
day
came
the
vision
I
suppose
hungry
men
often
do
see
visions
but
then
there
is
this
fruit
He
lifted
the
wrapped
globe
in
his
hand
And
I
have
heard
it
too
from
other
mountaineers
who
have
known
something
of
the
legend
It
was
in
the
evening
time
when
the
stars
were
increasing
that
they
came
down
a
slope
of
polished
rock
into
a
huge
dark
valley
all
set
about
with
strange
contorted
trees
and
in
these
trees
hung
little
globes
like
glowworm
spheres
strange
round
yellow
lights
Suddenly
this
valley
was
lit
far
away
many
miles
away
far
down
it
with
a
golden
flame
marching
slowly
athwart
it
that
made
the
stunted
trees
against
it
black
as
night
and
turned
the
slopes
all
about
them
and
their
figures
to
the
likeness
of
fiery
gold
And
at
the
vision
they
knowing
the
legends
of
the
mountains
instantly
knew
that
it
was
Eden
they
saw
or
the
sentinel
of
Eden
and
they
fell
upon
their
faces
like
men
struck
dead
When
they
dared
to
look
again
the
valley
was
dark
for
a
space
and
then
the
light
came
againreturning
a
burning
amber
At
that
the
shepherd
sprang
to
his
feet
and
with
a
shout
began
to
run
down
towards
the
light
but
the
other
man
was
too
fearful
to
follow
him
He
stood
stunned
amazed
and
terrified
watching
his
companion
recede
towards
the
marching
glare
And
hardly
had
the
shepherd
set
out
when
there
came
a
noise
like
thunder
the
beating
of
invisible
wings
hurrying
up
the
valley
and
a
great
and
terrible
fear
and
at
that
the
man
who
gave
me
the
fruit
turnedif
he
might
still
escape
And
hurrying
headlong
up
the
slope
again
with
that
tumult
sweeping
after
him
he
stumbled
against
one
of
these
stunted
bushes
and
a
ripe
fruit
came
off
it
into
his
hand
This
fruit
Forthwith
the
wings
and
the
thunder
rolled
all
about
him
He
fell
and
fainted
and
when
he
came
to
his
senses
he
was
back
among
the
blackened
ruins
of
his
own
village
and
I
and
the
others
were
attending
to
the
wounded
A
vision
But
the
golden
fruit
of
the
tree
was
still
clutched
in
his
hand
There
were
others
there
who
knew
the
legend
knew
what
that
strange
fruit
might
be
He
paused
And
this
is
it
he
said
It
was
a
most
extraordinary
story
to
be
told
in
a
thirdclass
carriage
on
a
Sussex
railway
It
was
as
if
the
real
was
a
mere
veil
to
the
fantastic
and
here
was
the
fantastic
poking
through
Is
it
was
all
Mr
Hinchcliff
could
say
The
legend
said
the
stranger
tells
that
those
thickets
of
dwarfed
trees
growing
about
the
garden
sprang
from
the
apple
that
Adam
carried
in
his
hand
when
he
and
Eve
were
driven
forth
He
felt
something
in
his
hand
saw
the
halfeaten
apple
and
flung
it
petulantly
aside
And
there
they
grow
in
that
desolate
valley
girdled
round
with
the
everlasting
snows
and
there
the
fiery
swords
keep
ward
against
the
Judgment
Day
But
I
thought
these
things

Do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
there
in
Armenia
The
stranger
answered
the
unfinished
question
with
the
fruit
in
his
open
hand
But
you
dont
know
said
Mr
Hinchcliff
that
that
is
the
fruit
of
the
Tree
of
Knowledge
The
man
may
have
hada
sort
of
mirage
say
Suppose
Look
at
it
said
the
stranger
It
was
certainly
a
strangelooking
globe
not
really
an
apple
Mr
Hinchcliff
saw
and
a
curious
glowing
golden
colour
almost
as
though
light
itself
was
wrought
into
its
substance
As
he
looked
at
it
he
began
to
see
more
vividly
the
desolate
valley
among
the
mountains
the
guarding
swords
of
fire
the
strange
antiquities
of
the
story
he
had
just
heard
He
rubbed
a
knuckle
into
his
eye
Butsaid
he
It
has
kept
like
that
smooth
and
full
three
months
Longer
than
that
it
is
now
by
some
days
No
drying
no
withering
no
decay
And
you
yourself
said
Mr
Hinchcliff
really
believe
that
Is
the
Forbidden
Fruit
There
was
no
mistaking
the
earnestness
of
the
mans
manner
and
his
perfect
sanity
The
Fruit
of
Knowledge
he
said
Suppose
it
was
said
Mr
Hinchcliff
after
a
pause
still
staring
at
it
But
after
all
said
Mr
Hinchcliff
its
not
my
kind
of
knowledgenot
the
sort
of
knowledge
I
mean
Adam
and
Eve
have
eaten
it
already
We
inherit
their
sinsnot
their
knowledge
said
the
stranger
That
would
make
it
all
clear
and
bright
again
We
should
see
into
everything
through
everything
into
the
deepest
meaning
of
everything
Why
dont
you
eat
it
then
said
Mr
Hinchcliff
with
an
inspiration
I
took
it
intending
to
eat
it
said
the
stranger
Man
has
fallen
Merely
to
eat
again
could
scarcely
Knowledge
is
power
said
Mr
Hinchcliff
But
is
it
happiness
I
am
older
than
youmore
than
twice
as
old
Time
after
time
I
have
held
this
in
my
hand
and
my
heart
has
failed
me
at
the
thought
of
all
that
one
might
know
that
terrible
lucidity
Suppose
suddenly
all
the
world
became
pitilessly
clear
That
I
think
would
be
a
great
advantage
said
Mr
Hinchcliff
on
the
whole
Suppose
you
saw
into
the
hearts
and
minds
of
everyone
about
you
into
their
most
secret
recessespeople
you
loved
whose
love
you
valued
Youd
soon
find
out
the
humbugs
said
Mr
Hinchcliff
greatly
struck
by
the
idea
And
worseto
know
yourself
bare
of
your
most
intimate
illusions
To
see
yourself
in
your
place
All
that
your
lusts
and
weaknesses
prevented
your
doing
No
merciful
perspective
That
might
be
an
excellent
thing
too
Know
thyself
you
know
You
are
young
said
the
stranger
If
you
dont
care
to
eat
it
and
it
bothers
you
why
dont
you
throw
it
away
There
again
perhaps
you
will
not
understand
me
To
me
how
could
one
throw
away
a
thing
like
that
glowing
wonderful
Once
one
has
it
one
is
bound
But
on
the
other
hand
to
give
it
away!
To
give
it
away
to
someone
who
thirsted
after
knowledge
who
found
no
terror
in
the
thought
of
that
clear
perception
Of
course
said
Mr
Hinchcliff
thoughtfully
it
might
be
some
sort
of
poisonous
fruit
And
then
his
eye
caught
something
motionless
the
end
of
a
white
board
blacklettered
outside
the
carriage
window
MWOOD
he
saw
He
started
convulsively
Gracious!
said
Mr
Hinchcliff
Holmwood!and
the
practical
present
blotted
out
the
mystic
realisations
that
had
been
stealing
upon
him
In
another
moment
he
was
opening
the
carriagedoor
portmanteau
in
hand
The
guard
was
already
fluttering
his
green
flag
Mr
Hinchcliff
jumped
out
Here!
said
a
voice
behind
him
and
he
saw
the
dark
eyes
of
the
stranger
shining
and
the
golden
fruit
bright
and
bare
held
out
of
the
open
carriagedoor
He
took
it
instinctively
the
train
was
already
moving
No!
shouted
the
stranger
and
made
a
snatch
at
it
as
if
to
take
it
back
Stand
away
cried
a
country
porter
thrusting
forward
to
close
the
door
The
stranger
shouted
something
Mr
Hinchcliff
did
not
catch
head
and
arm
thrust
excitedly
out
of
the
window
and
then
the
shadow
of
the
bridge
fell
on
him
and
in
a
trice
he
was
hidden
Mr
Hinchcliff
stood
astonished
staring
at
the
end
of
the
last
waggon
receding
round
the
bend
and
with
the
wonderful
fruit
in
his
hand
For
the
fraction
of
a
minute
his
mind
was
confused
and
then
he
became
aware
that
two
or
three
people
on
the
platform
were
regarding
him
with
interest
Was
he
not
the
new
Grammar
School
master
making
his
d
but
It
occurred
to
him
that
so
far
as
they
could
tell
the
fruit
might
very
well
be
the
na
refreshment
of
an
orange
He
flushed
at
the
thought
and
thrust
the
fruit
into
his
side
pocket
where
it
bulged
undesirably
But
there
was
no
help
for
it
so
he
went
towards
them
awkwardly
concealing
his
sense
of
awkwardness
to
ask
the
way
to
the
Grammar
School
and
the
means
of
getting
his
portmanteau
and
the
two
tin
boxes
which
lay
up
the
platform
thither
Of
all
the
odd
and
fantastic
yarns
to
tell
a
fellow!
His
luggage
could
be
taken
on
a
truck
for
sixpence
he
found
and
he
could
precede
it
on
foot
He
fancied
an
ironical
note
in
the
voices
He
was
painfully
aware
of
his
contour
The
curious
earnestness
of
the
man
in
the
train
and
the
glamour
of
the
story
he
told
had
for
a
time
diverted
the
current
of
Mr
Hinchcliffs
thoughts
It
drove
like
a
mist
before
his
immediate
concerns
Fires
that
went
to
and
fro!
But
the
preoccupation
of
his
new
position
and
the
impression
he
was
to
produce
upon
Holmwood
generally
and
the
school
people
in
particular
returned
upon
him
with
reinvigorating
power
before
he
left
the
station
and
cleared
his
mental
atmosphere
But
it
is
extraordinary
what
an
inconvenient
thing
the
addition
of
a
soft
and
rather
brightlygolden
fruit
not
three
inches
in
diameter
may
prove
to
a
sensitive
youth
on
his
best
appearance
In
the
pocket
of
his
black
jacket
it
bulged
dreadfully
spoilt
the
lines
altogether
He
passed
a
little
old
lady
in
black
and
he
felt
her
eye
drop
upon
the
excrescence
at
once
He
was
wearing
one
glove
and
carrying
the
other
together
with
his
stick
so
that
to
bear
the
fruit
openly
was
impossible
In
one
place
where
the
road
into
the
town
seemed
suitably
secluded
he
took
his
encumbrance
out
of
his
pocket
and
tried
it
in
his
hat
It
was
just
too
large
the
hat
wobbled
ludicrously
and
just
as
he
was
taking
it
out
again
a
butchers
boy
came
driving
round
the
corner
Confound
it!
said
Mr
Hinchcliff
He
would
have
eaten
the
thing
and
attained
omniscience
there
and
then
but
it
would
seem
so
silly
to
go
into
the
town
sucking
a
juicy
fruitand
it
certainly
felt
juicy
If
one
of
the
boys
should
come
by
it
might
do
him
a
serious
injury
with
his
discipline
so
to
be
seen
And
the
juice
might
make
his
face
sticky
and
get
upon
his
cuffsor
it
might
be
an
acid
juice
as
potent
as
lemon
and
take
all
the
colour
out
of
his
clothes
Then
round
a
bend
in
the
lane
came
two
pleasant
sunlit
girlish
figures
They
were
walking
slowly
towards
the
town
and
chatteringat
any
moment
they
might
look
round
and
see
a
hotfaced
young
man
behind
them
carrying
a
kind
of
phosphorescent
yellow
tomato!
They
would
be
sure
to
laugh
Hang!
said
Mr
Hinchcliff
and
with
a
swift
jerk
sent
the
encumbrance
flying
over
the
stone
wall
of
an
orchard
that
there
abutted
on
the
road
As
it
vanished
he
felt
a
faint
twinge
of
loss
that
lasted
scarcely
a
moment
He
adjusted
the
stick
and
glove
in
his
hand
and
walked
on
erect
and
selfconscious
to
pass
the
girls





But
in
the
darkness
of
the
night
Mr
Hinchcliff
had
a
dream
and
saw
the
valley
and
the
flaming
swords
and
the
contorted
trees
and
knew
that
it
really
was
the
Apple
of
the
Tree
of
Knowledge
that
he
had
thrown
regardlessly
away
And
he
awoke
very
unhappy
In
the
morning
his
regret
had
passed
but
afterwards
it
returned
and
troubled
him
never
however
when
he
was
happy
or
busily
occupied
At
last
one
moonlight
night
about
eleven
when
all
Holmwood
was
quiet
his
regrets
returned
with
redoubled
force
and
therewith
an
impulse
to
adventure
He
slipped
out
of
the
house
and
over
the
playground
wall
went
through
the
silent
town
to
Station
Lane
and
climbed
into
the
orchard
where
he
had
thrown
the
fruit
But
nothing
was
to
be
found
of
it
there
among
the
dewy
grass
and
the
faint
intangible
globes
of
dandelion
down
UNDER
THE
KNIFE
What
if
I
die
under
it
The
thought
recurred
again
and
again
as
I
walked
home
from
Haddons
It
was
a
purely
personal
question
I
was
spared
the
deep
anxieties
of
a
married
man
and
I
knew
there
were
few
of
my
intimate
friends
but
would
find
my
death
troublesome
chiefly
on
account
of
their
duty
of
regret
I
was
surprised
indeed
and
perhaps
a
little
humiliated
as
I
turned
the
matter
over
to
think
how
few
could
possibly
exceed
the
conventional
requirement
Things
came
before
me
stripped
of
glamour
in
a
clear
dry
light
during
that
walk
from
Haddons
house
over
Primrose
Hill
There
were
the
friends
of
my
youth
I
perceived
now
that
our
affection
was
a
tradition
which
we
foregathered
rather
laboriously
to
maintain
There
were
the
rivals
and
helpers
of
my
later
career
I
suppose
I
had
been
coldblooded
or
undemonstrativeone
perhaps
implies
the
other
It
may
be
that
even
the
capacity
for
friendship
is
a
question
of
physique
There
had
been
a
time
in
my
own
life
when
I
had
grieved
bitterly
enough
at
the
loss
of
a
friend
but
as
I
walked
home
that
afternoon
the
emotional
side
of
my
imagination
was
dormant
I
could
not
pity
myself
nor
feel
sorry
for
my
friends
nor
conceive
of
them
as
grieving
for
me
I
was
interested
in
this
deadness
of
my
emotional
natureno
doubt
a
concomitant
of
my
stagnating
physiology
and
my
thoughts
wandered
off
along
the
line
it
suggested
Once
before
in
my
hot
youth
I
had
suffered
a
sudden
loss
of
blood
and
had
been
within
an
ace
of
death
I
remembered
now
that
my
affections
as
well
as
my
passions
had
drained
out
of
me
leaving
scarce
anything
but
a
tranquil
resignation
a
dreg
of
selfpity
It
had
been
weeks
before
the
old
ambitions
and
tendernesses
and
all
the
complex
moral
interplay
of
a
man
had
reasserted
themselves
It
occurred
to
me
that
the
real
meaning
of
this
numbness
might
be
a
gradual
slipping
away
from
the
pleasurepain
guidance
of
the
animal
man
It
has
been
proven
I
take
it
as
thoroughly
as
anything
can
be
proven
in
this
world
that
the
higher
emotions
the
moral
feelings
even
the
subtle
tendernesses
of
love
are
evolved
from
the
elemental
desires
and
fears
of
the
simple
animal
they
are
the
harness
in
which
mans
mental
freedom
goes
And
it
may
be
that
as
death
overshadows
us
as
our
possibility
of
acting
diminishes
this
complex
growth
of
balanced
impulse
propensity
and
aversion
whose
interplay
inspires
our
acts
goes
with
it
Leaving
what
I
was
suddenly
brought
back
to
reality
by
an
imminent
collision
with
a
butcherboys
tray
I
found
that
I
was
crossing
the
bridge
over
the
Regents
Park
Canal
which
runs
parallel
with
that
in
the
Zoological
Gardens
The
boy
in
blue
had
been
looking
over
his
shoulder
at
a
black
barge
advancing
slowly
towed
by
a
gaunt
white
horse
In
the
Gardens
a
nurse
was
leading
three
happy
little
children
over
the
bridge
The
trees
were
bright
green
the
spring
hopefulness
was
still
unstained
by
the
dusts
of
summer
the
sky
in
the
water
was
bright
and
clear
but
broken
by
long
waves
by
quivering
bands
of
black
as
the
barge
drove
through
The
breeze
was
stirring
but
it
did
not
stir
me
as
the
spring
breeze
used
to
do
Was
this
dulness
of
feeling
in
itself
an
anticipation
It
was
curious
that
I
could
reason
and
follow
out
a
network
of
suggestion
as
clearly
as
ever
so
at
least
it
seemed
to
me
It
was
calmness
rather
than
dulness
that
was
coming
upon
me
Was
there
any
ground
for
the
belief
in
the
presentiment
of
death
Did
a
man
near
to
death
begin
instinctively
to
withdraw
himself
from
the
meshes
of
matter
and
sense
even
before
the
cold
hand
was
laid
upon
his
I
felt
strangely
isolatedisolated
without
regretfrom
the
life
and
existence
about
me
The
children
playing
in
the
sun
and
gathering
strength
and
experience
for
the
business
of
life
the
parkkeeper
gossiping
with
a
nursemaid
the
nursing
mother
the
young
couple
intent
upon
each
other
as
they
passed
me
the
trees
by
the
wayside
spreading
new
pleading
leaves
to
the
sunlight
the
stir
in
their
branchesI
had
been
part
of
it
all
but
I
had
nearly
done
with
it
now
Some
way
down
the
Broad
Walk
I
perceived
that
I
was
tired
and
that
my
feet
were
heavy
It
was
hot
that
afternoon
and
I
turned
aside
and
sat
down
on
one
of
the
green
chairs
that
line
the
way
In
a
minute
I
had
dozed
into
a
dream
and
the
tide
of
my
thoughts
washed
up
a
vision
of
the
resurrection
I
was
still
sitting
in
the
chair
but
I
thought
myself
actually
dead
withered
tattered
dried
one
eye
I
saw
pecked
out
by
birds
Awake!
cried
a
voice
and
incontinently
the
dust
of
the
path
and
the
mould
under
the
grass
became
insurgent
I
had
never
before
thought
of
Regents
Park
as
a
cemetery
but
now
through
the
trees
stretching
as
far
as
eye
could
see
I
beheld
a
flat
plain
of
writhing
graves
and
heeling
tombstones
There
seemed
to
be
some
trouble
the
rising
dead
appeared
to
stifle
as
they
struggled
upward
they
bled
in
their
struggles
the
red
flesh
was
tattered
away
from
the
white
bones
Awake!
cried
a
voice
but
I
determined
I
would
not
rise
to
such
horrors
Awake!
They
would
not
let
me
alone
Wike
up!
said
an
angry
voice
A
cockney
angel!
The
man
who
sells
the
tickets
was
shaking
me
demanding
my
penny
I
paid
my
penny
pocketed
my
ticket
yawned
stretched
my
legs
and
feeling
now
rather
less
torpid
got
up
and
walked
on
towards
Langham
Place
I
speedily
lost
myself
again
in
a
shifting
maze
of
thoughts
about
death
Going
across
Marylebone
Road
into
that
crescent
at
the
end
of
Langham
Place
I
had
the
narrowest
escape
from
the
shaft
of
a
cab
and
went
on
my
way
with
a
palpitating
heart
and
a
bruised
shoulder
It
struck
me
that
it
would
have
been
curious
if
my
meditations
on
my
death
on
the
morrow
had
led
to
my
death
that
day
But
I
will
not
weary
you
with
more
of
my
experiences
that
day
and
the
next
I
knew
more
and
more
certainly
that
I
should
die
under
the
operation
at
times
I
think
I
was
inclined
to
pose
to
myself
The
doctors
were
coming
at
eleven
and
I
did
not
get
up
It
seemed
scarce
worth
while
to
trouble
about
washing
and
dressing
and
though
I
read
my
newspapers
and
the
letters
that
came
by
the
first
post
I
did
not
find
them
very
interesting
There
was
a
friendly
note
from
Addison
my
old
school
friend
calling
my
attention
to
two
discrepancies
and
a
printers
error
in
my
new
book
with
one
from
Langridge
venting
some
vexation
over
Minton
The
rest
were
business
communications
I
breakfasted
in
bed
The
glow
of
pain
at
my
side
seemed
more
massive
I
knew
it
was
pain
and
yet
if
you
can
understand
I
did
not
find
it
very
painful
I
had
been
awake
and
hot
and
thirsty
in
the
night
but
in
the
morning
bed
felt
comfortable
In
the
nighttime
I
had
lain
thinking
of
things
that
were
past
in
the
morning
I
dozed
over
the
question
of
immortality
Haddon
came
punctual
to
the
minute
with
a
neat
black
bag
and
Mowbray
soon
followed
Their
arrival
stirred
me
up
a
little
I
began
to
take
a
more
personal
interest
in
the
proceedings
Haddon
moved
the
little
octagonal
table
close
to
the
bedside
and
with
his
broad
black
back
to
me
began
taking
things
out
of
his
bag
I
heard
the
light
click
of
steel
upon
steel
My
imagination
I
found
was
not
altogether
stagnant
Will
you
hurt
me
much
I
said
in
an
offhand
tone
Not
a
bit
Haddon
answered
over
his
shoulder
We
shall
chloroform
you
Your
hearts
as
sound
as
a
bell
And
as
he
spoke
I
had
a
whiff
of
the
pungent
sweetness
of
the
an
sthetic
They
stretched
me
out
with
a
convenient
exposure
of
my
side
and
almost
before
I
realised
what
was
happening
the
chloroform
was
being
administered
It
stings
the
nostrils
and
there
is
a
suffocating
sensation
at
first
I
knew
I
should
diethat
this
was
the
end
of
consciousness
for
me
And
suddenly
I
felt
that
I
was
not
prepared
for
death
I
had
a
vague
sense
of
a
duty
overlookedI
knew
not
what
What
was
it
I
had
not
done
I
could
think
of
nothing
more
to
do
nothing
desirable
left
in
life
and
yet
I
had
the
strangest
disinclination
to
death
And
the
physical
sensation
was
painfully
oppressive
Of
course
the
doctors
did
not
know
they
were
going
to
kill
me
Possibly
I
struggled
Then
I
fell
motionless
and
a
great
silence
a
monstrous
silence
and
an
impenetrable
blackness
came
upon
me
There
must
have
been
an
interval
of
absolute
unconsciousness
seconds
or
minutes
Then
with
a
chilly
unemotional
clearness
I
perceived
that
I
was
not
yet
dead
I
was
still
in
my
body
but
all
the
multitudinous
sensations
that
come
sweeping
from
it
to
make
up
the
background
of
consciousness
had
gone
leaving
me
free
of
it
all
No
not
free
of
it
all
for
as
yet
something
still
held
me
to
the
poor
stark
flesh
upon
the
bedheld
me
yet
not
so
closely
that
I
did
not
feel
myself
external
to
it
independent
of
it
straining
away
from
it
I
do
not
think
I
saw
I
do
not
think
I
heard
but
I
perceived
all
that
was
going
on
and
it
was
as
if
I
both
heard
and
saw
Haddon
was
bending
over
me
Mowbray
behind
me
the
scalpelit
was
a
large
scalpelwas
cutting
my
flesh
at
the
side
under
the
flying
ribs
It
was
interesting
to
see
myself
cut
like
cheese
without
a
pang
without
even
a
qualm
The
interest
was
much
of
a
quality
with
that
one
might
feel
in
a
game
of
chess
between
strangers
Haddons
face
was
firm
and
his
hand
steady
but
I
was
surprised
to
perceive
how
I
know
not
that
he
was
feeling
the
gravest
doubt
as
to
his
own
wisdom
in
the
conduct
of
the
operation
Mowbrays
thoughts
too
I
could
see
He
was
thinking
that
Haddons
manner
showed
too
much
of
the
specialist
New
suggestions
came
up
like
bubbles
through
a
stream
of
frothing
meditation
and
burst
one
after
another
in
the
little
bright
spot
of
his
consciousness
He
could
not
help
noticing
and
admiring
Haddons
swift
dexterity
in
spite
of
his
envious
quality
and
his
disposition
to
detract
I
saw
my
liver
exposed
I
was
puzzled
at
my
own
condition
I
did
not
feel
that
I
was
dead
but
I
was
different
in
some
way
from
my
living
self
The
grey
depression
that
had
weighed
on
me
for
a
year
or
more
and
coloured
all
my
thoughts
was
gone
I
perceived
and
thought
without
any
emotional
tint
at
all
I
wondered
if
everyone
perceived
things
in
this
way
under
chloroform
and
forgot
it
again
when
he
came
out
of
it
It
would
be
inconvenient
to
look
into
some
heads
and
not
forget
Although
I
did
not
think
that
I
was
dead
I
still
perceived
quite
clearly
that
I
was
soon
to
die
This
brought
me
back
to
the
consideration
of
Haddons
proceedings
I
looked
into
his
mind
and
saw
that
he
was
afraid
of
cutting
a
branch
of
the
portal
vein
My
attention
was
distracted
from
details
by
the
curious
changes
going
on
in
his
mind
His
consciousness
was
like
the
quivering
little
spot
of
light
which
is
thrown
by
the
mirror
of
a
galvanometer
His
thoughts
ran
under
it
like
a
stream
some
through
the
focus
bright
and
distinct
some
shadowy
in
the
halflight
of
the
edge
Just
now
the
little
glow
was
steady
but
the
least
movement
on
Mowbrays
part
the
slightest
sound
from
outside
even
a
faint
difference
in
the
slow
movement
of
the
living
flesh
he
was
cutting
set
the
lightspot
shivering
and
spinning
A
new
senseimpression
came
rushing
up
through
the
flow
of
thoughts
and
lo!
the
lightspot
jerked
away
towards
it
swifter
than
a
frightened
fish
It
was
wonderful
to
think
that
upon
that
unstable
fitful
thing
depended
all
the
complex
motions
of
the
man
that
for
the
next
five
minutes
therefore
my
life
hung
upon
its
movements
And
he
was
growing
more
and
more
nervous
in
his
work
It
was
as
if
a
little
picture
of
a
cut
vein
grew
brighter
and
struggled
to
oust
from
his
brain
another
picture
of
a
cut
falling
short
of
the
mark
He
was
afraid
his
dread
of
cutting
too
little
was
battling
with
his
dread
of
cutting
too
far
Then
suddenly
like
an
escape
of
water
from
under
a
lockgate
a
great
uprush
of
horrible
realisation
set
all
his
thoughts
swirling
and
simultaneously
I
perceived
that
the
vein
was
cut
He
started
back
with
a
hoarse
exclamation
and
I
saw
the
brownpurple
blood
gather
in
a
swift
bead
and
run
trickling
He
was
horrified
He
pitched
the
redstained
scalpel
on
to
the
octagonal
table
and
instantly
both
doctors
flung
themselves
upon
me
making
hasty
and
illconceived
efforts
to
remedy
the
disaster
Ice!
said
Mowbray
gasping
But
I
knew
that
I
was
killed
though
my
body
still
clung
to
me
I
will
not
describe
their
belated
endeavours
to
save
me
though
I
perceived
every
detail
My
perceptions
were
sharper
and
swifter
than
they
had
ever
been
in
life
my
thoughts
rushed
through
my
mind
with
incredible
swiftness
but
with
perfect
definition
I
can
only
compare
their
crowded
clarity
to
the
effects
of
a
reasonable
dose
of
opium
In
a
moment
it
would
all
be
over
and
I
should
be
free
I
knew
I
was
immortal
but
what
would
happen
I
did
not
know
Should
I
drift
off
presently
like
a
puff
of
smoke
from
a
gun
in
some
kind
of
halfmaterial
body
an
attenuated
version
of
my
material
self
Should
I
find
myself
suddenly
among
the
innumerable
hosts
of
the
dead
and
know
the
world
about
me
for
the
phantasmagoria
it
had
always
seemed
Should
I
drift
to
some
spiritualistic
s
ance
and
there
make
foolish
incomprehensible
attempts
to
affect
a
purblind
medium
It
was
a
state
of
unemotional
curiosity
of
colourless
expectation
And
then
I
realised
a
growing
stress
upon
me
a
feeling
as
though
some
huge
human
magnet
was
drawing
me
upward
out
of
my
body
The
stress
grew
and
grew
I
seemed
an
atom
for
which
monstrous
forces
were
fighting
For
one
brief
terrible
moment
sensation
came
back
to
me
That
feeling
of
falling
headlong
which
comes
in
nightmares
that
feeling
a
thousand
times
intensified
that
and
a
black
horror
swept
across
my
thoughts
in
a
torrent
Then
the
two
doctors
the
naked
body
with
its
cut
side
the
little
room
swept
away
from
under
me
and
vanished
as
a
speck
of
foam
vanishes
down
an
eddy
I
was
in
midair
Far
below
was
the
West
End
of
London
receding
rapidlyfor
I
seemed
to
be
flying
swiftly
upwardand
as
it
receded
passing
westward
like
a
panorama
I
could
see
through
the
faint
haze
of
smoke
the
innumerable
roofs
chimneyset
the
narrow
roadways
stippled
with
people
and
conveyances
the
little
specks
of
squares
and
the
church
steeples
like
thorns
sticking
out
of
the
fabric
But
it
spun
away
as
the
earth
rotated
on
its
axis
and
in
a
few
seconds
as
it
seemed
I
was
over
the
scattered
clumps
of
town
about
Ealing
the
little
Thames
a
thread
of
blue
to
the
south
and
the
Chiltern
Hills
and
the
North
Downs
coming
up
like
the
rim
of
a
basin
far
away
and
faint
with
haze
Up
I
rushed
And
at
first
I
had
not
the
faintest
conception
what
this
headlong
rush
upward
could
mean
Every
moment
the
circle
of
scenery
beneath
me
grew
wider
and
wider
and
the
details
of
town
and
field
of
hill
and
valley
got
more
and
more
hazy
and
pale
and
indistinct
a
luminous
grey
was
mingled
more
and
more
with
the
blue
of
the
hills
and
the
green
of
the
open
meadows
and
a
little
patch
of
cloud
low
and
far
to
the
west
shone
ever
more
dazzlingly
white
Above
as
the
veil
of
atmosphere
between
myself
and
outer
space
grew
thinner
the
sky
which
had
been
a
fair
springtime
blue
at
first
grew
deeper
and
richer
in
colour
passing
steadily
through
the
intervening
shades
until
presently
it
was
as
dark
as
the
blue
sky
of
midnight
and
presently
as
black
as
the
blackness
of
a
frosty
starlight
and
at
last
as
black
as
no
blackness
I
had
ever
beheld
And
first
one
star
and
then
many
and
at
last
an
innumerable
host
broke
out
upon
the
sky
more
stars
than
anyone
has
ever
seen
from
the
face
of
the
earth
For
the
blueness
of
the
sky
is
the
light
of
the
sun
and
stars
sifted
and
spread
abroad
blindingly
there
is
diffused
light
even
in
the
darkest
skies
of
winter
and
we
do
not
see
the
stars
by
day
only
because
of
the
dazzling
irradiation
of
the
sun
But
now
I
saw
thingsI
know
not
how
assuredly
with
no
mortal
eyesand
that
defect
of
bedazzlement
blinded
me
no
longer
The
sun
was
incredibly
strange
and
wonderful
The
body
of
it
was
a
disc
of
blinding
white
light
not
yellowish
as
it
seems
to
those
who
live
upon
the
earth
but
livid
white
all
streaked
with
scarlet
streaks
and
rimmed
about
with
a
fringe
of
writhing
tongues
of
red
fire
And
shooting
halfway
across
the
heavens
from
either
side
of
it
and
brighter
than
the
Milky
Way
were
two
pinions
of
silverwhite
making
it
look
more
like
those
winged
globes
I
have
seen
in
Egyptian
sculpture
than
anything
else
I
can
remember
upon
earth
These
I
knew
for
the
solar
corona
though
I
had
never
seen
anything
of
it
but
a
picture
during
the
days
of
my
earthly
life
When
my
attention
came
back
to
the
earth
again
I
saw
that
it
had
fallen
very
far
away
from
me
Field
and
town
were
long
since
indistinguishable
and
all
the
varied
hues
of
the
country
were
merging
into
a
uniform
bright
grey
broken
only
by
the
brilliant
white
of
the
clouds
that
lay
scattered
in
flocculent
masses
over
Ireland
and
the
west
of
England
For
now
I
could
see
the
outlines
of
the
north
of
France
and
Ireland
and
all
this
island
of
Britain
save
where
Scotland
passed
over
the
horizon
to
the
north
or
where
the
coast
was
blurred
or
obliterated
by
cloud
The
sea
was
a
dull
grey
and
darker
than
the
land
and
the
whole
panorama
was
rotating
slowly
towards
the
east
All
this
had
happened
so
swiftly
that
until
I
was
some
thousand
miles
or
so
from
the
earth
I
had
no
thought
for
myself
But
now
I
perceived
I
had
neither
hands
nor
feet
neither
parts
nor
organs
and
that
I
felt
neither
alarm
nor
pain
All
about
me
I
perceived
that
the
vacancy
for
I
had
already
left
the
air
behind
was
cold
beyond
the
imagination
of
man
but
it
troubled
me
not
The
suns
rays
shot
through
the
void
powerless
to
light
or
heat
until
they
should
strike
on
matter
in
their
course
I
saw
things
with
a
serene
selfforgetfulness
even
as
if
I
were
God
And
down
below
there
rushing
away
from
mecountless
miles
in
a
secondwhere
a
little
dark
spot
on
the
grey
marked
the
position
of
London
two
doctors
were
struggling
to
restore
life
to
the
poor
hacked
and
outworn
shell
I
had
abandoned
I
felt
then
such
release
such
serenity
as
I
can
compare
to
no
mortal
delight
I
have
ever
known
It
was
only
after
I
had
perceived
all
these
things
that
the
meaning
of
that
headlong
rush
of
the
earth
grew
into
comprehension
Yet
it
was
so
simple
so
obvious
that
I
was
amazed
at
my
never
anticipating
the
thing
that
was
happening
to
me
I
had
suddenly
been
cut
adrift
from
matter
all
that
was
material
of
me
was
there
upon
earth
whirling
away
through
space
held
to
the
earth
by
gravitation
partaking
of
the
earthinertia
moving
in
its
wreath
of
epicycles
round
the
sun
and
with
the
sun
and
the
planets
on
their
vast
march
through
space
But
the
immaterial
has
no
inertia
feels
nothing
of
the
pull
of
matter
for
matter
where
it
parts
from
its
garment
of
flesh
there
it
remains
so
far
as
space
concerns
it
any
longer
immovable
in
space
I
was
not
leaving
the
earth
the
earth
was
leaving
me
and
not
only
the
earth
but
the
whole
solar
system
was
streaming
past
And
about
me
in
space
invisible
to
me
scattered
in
the
wake
of
the
earth
upon
its
journey
there
must
be
an
innumerable
multitude
of
souls
stripped
like
myself
of
the
material
stripped
like
myself
of
the
passions
of
the
individual
and
the
generous
emotions
of
the
gregarious
brute
naked
intelligences
things
of
newborn
wonder
and
thought
marvelling
at
the
strange
release
that
had
suddenly
come
on
them!
As
I
receded
faster
and
faster
from
the
strange
white
sun
in
the
black
heavens
and
from
the
broad
and
shining
earth
upon
which
my
being
had
begun
I
seemed
to
grow
in
some
incredible
manner
vast
vast
as
regards
this
world
I
had
left
vast
as
regards
the
moments
and
periods
of
a
human
life
Very
soon
I
saw
the
full
circle
of
the
earth
slightly
gibbous
like
the
moon
when
she
nears
her
full
but
very
large
and
the
silvery
shape
of
America
was
now
in
the
noonday
blaze
wherein
as
it
seemed
little
England
had
been
basking
but
a
few
minutes
ago
At
first
the
earth
was
large
and
shone
in
the
heavens
filling
a
great
part
of
them
but
every
moment
she
grew
smaller
and
more
distant
As
she
shrunk
the
broad
moon
in
its
third
quarter
crept
into
view
over
the
rim
of
her
disc
I
looked
for
the
constellations
Only
that
part
of
Aries
directly
behind
the
sun
and
the
Lion
which
the
earth
covered
were
hidden
I
recognised
the
tortuous
tattered
band
of
the
Milky
Way
with
Vega
very
bright
between
sun
and
earth
and
Sirius
and
Orion
shone
splendid
against
the
unfathomable
blackness
in
the
opposite
quarter
of
the
heavens
The
Pole
Star
was
overhead
and
the
Great
Bear
hung
over
the
circle
of
the
earth
And
away
beneath
and
beyond
the
shining
corona
of
the
sun
were
strange
groupings
of
stars
I
had
never
seen
in
my
lifenotably
a
daggershaped
group
that
I
knew
for
the
Southern
Cross
All
these
were
no
larger
than
when
they
had
shone
on
earth
but
the
little
stars
that
one
scarce
sees
shone
now
against
the
setting
of
black
vacancy
as
brightly
as
the
firstmagnitudes
had
done
while
the
larger
worlds
were
points
of
indescribable
glory
and
colour
Aldebaran
was
a
spot
of
bloodred
fire
and
Sirius
condensed
to
one
point
the
light
of
a
world
of
sapphires
And
they
shone
steadily
they
did
not
scintillate
they
were
calmly
glorious
My
impressions
had
an
adamantine
hardness
and
brightness
there
was
no
blurring
softness
no
atmosphere
nothing
but
infinite
darkness
set
with
the
myriads
of
these
acute
and
brilliant
points
and
specks
of
light
Presently
when
I
looked
again
the
little
earth
seemed
no
bigger
than
the
sun
and
it
dwindled
and
turned
as
I
looked
until
in
a
seconds
space
as
it
seemed
to
me
it
was
halved
and
so
it
went
on
swiftly
dwindling
Far
away
in
the
opposite
direction
a
little
pinkish
pins
head
of
light
shining
steadily
was
the
planet
Mars
I
swam
motionless
in
vacancy
and
without
a
trace
of
terror
or
astonishment
watched
the
speck
of
cosmic
dust
we
call
the
world
fall
away
from
me
Presently
it
dawned
upon
me
that
my
sense
of
duration
had
changed
that
my
mind
was
moving
not
faster
but
infinitely
slower
that
between
each
separate
impression
there
was
a
period
of
many
days
The
moon
spun
once
round
the
earth
as
I
noted
this
and
I
perceived
clearly
the
motion
of
Mars
in
his
orbit
Moreover
it
appeared
as
if
the
time
between
thought
and
thought
grew
steadily
greater
until
at
last
a
thousand
years
was
but
a
moment
in
my
perception
At
first
the
constellations
had
shone
motionless
against
the
black
background
of
infinite
space
but
presently
it
seemed
as
though
the
group
of
stars
about
Hercules
and
the
Scorpion
was
contracting
while
Orion
and
Aldebaran
and
their
neighbours
were
scattering
apart
Flashing
suddenly
out
of
the
darkness
there
came
a
flying
multitude
of
particles
of
rock
glittering
like
dustspecks
in
a
sunbeam
and
encompassed
in
a
faintly
luminous
haze
They
swirled
all
about
me
and
vanished
again
in
a
twinkling
far
behind
And
then
I
saw
that
a
bright
spot
of
light
that
shone
a
little
to
one
side
of
my
path
was
growing
very
rapidly
larger
and
perceived
that
it
was
the
planet
Saturn
rushing
towards
me
Larger
and
larger
it
grew
swallowing
up
the
heavens
behind
it
and
hiding
every
moment
a
fresh
multitude
of
stars
I
perceived
its
flattened
whirling
body
its
disclike
belt
and
seven
of
its
little
satellites
It
grew
and
grew
till
it
towered
enormous
and
then
I
plunged
amid
a
streaming
multitude
of
clashing
stones
and
dancing
dustparticles
and
gaseddies
and
saw
for
a
moment
the
mighty
triple
belt
like
three
concentric
arches
of
moonlight
above
me
its
shadow
black
on
the
boiling
tumult
below
These
things
happened
in
onetenth
of
the
time
it
takes
to
tell
of
them
The
planet
went
by
like
a
flash
of
lightning
for
a
few
seconds
it
blotted
out
the
sun
and
there
and
then
became
a
mere
black
dwindling
winged
patch
against
the
light
The
earth
the
mother
mote
of
my
being
I
could
no
longer
see
So
with
a
stately
swiftness
in
the
profoundest
silence
the
solar
system
fell
from
me
as
it
had
been
a
garment
until
the
sun
was
a
mere
star
amid
the
multitude
of
stars
with
its
eddy
of
planetspecks
lost
in
the
confused
glittering
of
the
remoter
light
I
was
no
longer
a
denizen
of
the
solar
system
I
had
come
to
the
Outer
Universe
I
seemed
to
grasp
and
comprehend
the
whole
world
of
matter
Ever
more
swiftly
the
stars
closed
in
about
the
spot
where
Antares
and
Vega
had
vanished
in
a
luminous
haze
until
that
part
of
the
sky
had
the
semblance
of
a
whirling
mass
of
nebul

and
ever
before
me
yawned
vaster
gaps
of
vacant
blackness
and
the
stars
shone
fewer
and
fewer
It
seemed
as
if
I
moved
towards
a
point
between
Orions
belt
and
sword
and
the
void
about
that
region
opened
vaster
and
vaster
every
second
an
incredible
gulf
of
nothingness
into
which
I
was
falling
Faster
and
ever
faster
the
universe
rushed
by
a
hurry
of
whirling
motes
at
last
speeding
silently
into
the
void
Stars
glowing
brighter
and
brighter
with
their
circling
planets
catching
the
light
in
a
ghostly
fashion
as
I
neared
them
shone
out
and
vanished
again
into
inexistence
faint
comets
clusters
of
meteorites
winking
specks
of
matter
eddying
light
points
whizzed
past
some
perhaps
a
hundred
millions
of
miles
or
so
from
me
at
most
few
nearer
travelling
with
unimaginable
rapidity
shooting
constellations
momentary
darts
of
fire
through
that
black
enormous
night
More
than
anything
else
it
was
like
a
dusty
draught
sunbeamlit
Broader
and
wider
and
deeper
grew
the
starless
space
the
vacant
Beyond
into
which
I
was
being
drawn
At
last
a
quarter
of
the
heavens
was
black
and
blank
and
the
whole
headlong
rush
of
stellar
universe
closed
in
behind
me
like
a
veil
of
light
that
is
gathered
together
It
drove
away
from
me
like
a
monstrous
jackolantern
driven
by
the
wind
I
had
come
out
into
the
wilderness
of
space
Ever
the
vacant
blackness
grew
broader
until
the
hosts
of
the
stars
seemed
only
like
a
swarm
of
fiery
specks
hurrying
away
from
me
inconceivably
remote
and
the
darkness
the
nothingness
and
emptiness
was
about
me
on
every
side
Soon
the
little
universe
of
matter
the
cage
of
points
in
which
I
had
begun
to
be
was
dwindling
now
to
a
whirling
disc
of
luminous
glittering
and
now
to
one
minute
disc
of
hazy
light
In
a
little
while
it
would
shrink
to
a
point
and
at
last
would
vanish
altogether
Suddenly
feeling
came
back
to
mefeeling
in
the
shape
of
overwhelming
terror
such
a
dread
of
those
dark
vastitudes
as
no
words
can
describe
a
passionate
resurgence
of
sympathy
and
social
desire
Were
there
other
souls
invisible
to
me
as
I
to
them
about
me
in
the
blackness
or
was
I
indeed
even
as
I
felt
alone
Had
I
passed
out
of
being
into
something
that
was
neither
being
nor
notbeing
The
covering
of
the
body
the
covering
of
matter
had
been
torn
from
me
and
the
hallucinations
of
companionship
and
security
Everything
was
black
and
silent
I
had
ceased
to
be
I
was
nothing
There
was
nothing
save
only
that
infinitesimal
dot
of
light
that
dwindled
in
the
gulf
I
strained
myself
to
hear
and
see
and
for
a
while
there
was
naught
but
infinite
silence
intolerable
darkness
horror
and
despair
Then
I
saw
that
about
the
spot
of
light
into
which
the
whole
world
of
matter
had
shrunk
there
was
a
faint
glow
And
in
a
band
on
either
side
of
that
the
darkness
was
not
absolute
I
watched
it
for
ages
as
it
seemed
to
me
and
through
the
long
waiting
the
haze
grew
imperceptibly
more
distinct
And
then
about
the
band
appeared
an
irregular
cloud
of
the
faintest
palest
brown
I
felt
a
passionate
impatience
but
the
things
grew
brighter
so
slowly
that
they
scarce
seemed
to
change
What
was
unfolding
itself
What
was
this
strange
reddish
dawn
in
the
interminable
night
of
space
The
clouds
shape
was
grotesque
It
seemed
to
be
looped
along
its
lower
side
into
four
projecting
masses
and
above
it
ended
in
a
straight
line
What
phantom
was
it
I
felt
assured
I
had
seen
that
figure
before
but
I
could
not
think
what
nor
where
nor
when
it
was
Then
the
realisation
rushed
upon
me
It
was
a
clenched
Hand
I
was
alone
in
space
alone
with
this
huge
shadowy
Hand
upon
which
the
whole
Universe
of
Matter
lay
like
an
unconsidered
speck
of
dust
It
seemed
as
though
I
watched
it
through
vast
periods
of
time
On
the
forefinger
glittered
a
ring
and
the
universe
from
which
I
had
come
was
but
a
spot
of
light
upon
the
rings
curvature
And
the
thing
that
the
hand
gripped
had
the
likeness
of
a
black
rod
Through
a
long
eternity
I
watched
this
Hand
with
the
ring
and
the
rod
marvelling
and
fearing
and
waiting
helplessly
on
what
might
follow
It
seemed
as
though
nothing
could
follow
that
I
should
watch
for
ever
seeing
only
the
Hand
and
the
thing
it
held
and
understanding
nothing
of
its
import
Was
the
whole
universe
but
a
refracting
speck
upon
some
greater
Being
Were
our
worlds
but
the
atoms
of
another
universe
and
those
again
of
another
and
so
on
through
an
endless
progression
And
what
was
I
Was
I
indeed
immaterial
A
vague
persuasion
of
a
body
gathering
about
me
came
into
my
suspense
The
abysmal
darkness
about
the
Hand
filled
with
impalpable
suggestions
with
uncertain
fluctuating
shapes
Then
suddenly
came
a
sound
like
the
sound
of
a
tolling
bell
faint
as
if
infinitely
far
muffled
as
though
heard
through
thick
swathings
of
darkness
a
deep
vibrating
resonance
with
vast
gulfs
of
silence
between
each
stroke
And
the
Hand
appeared
to
tighten
on
the
rod
And
I
saw
far
above
the
Hand
towards
the
apex
of
the
darkness
a
circle
of
dim
phosphorescence
a
ghostly
sphere
whence
these
sounds
came
throbbing
and
at
the
last
stroke
the
Hand
vanished
for
the
hour
had
come
and
I
heard
a
noise
of
many
waters
But
the
black
rod
remained
as
a
great
band
across
the
sky
And
then
a
voice
which
seemed
to
run
to
the
uttermost
parts
of
space
spoke
saying
There
will
be
no
more
pain
At
that
an
almost
intolerable
gladness
and
radiance
rushed
in
upon
me
and
I
saw
the
circle
shining
white
and
bright
and
the
rod
black
and
shining
and
many
things
else
distinct
and
clear
And
the
circle
was
the
face
of
the
clock
and
the
rod
the
rail
of
my
bed
Haddon
was
standing
at
the
foot
against
the
rail
with
a
small
pair
of
scissors
on
his
fingers
and
the
hands
of
my
clock
on
the
mantel
over
his
shoulder
were
clasped
together
over
the
hour
of
twelve
Mowbray
was
washing
something
in
a
basin
at
the
octagonal
table
and
at
my
side
I
felt
a
subdued
feeling
that
could
scarce
be
spoken
of
as
pain
The
operation
had
not
killed
me
And
I
perceived
suddenly
that
the
dull
melancholy
of
half
a
year
was
lifted
from
my
mind
THE
SEA
RAIDERS
Until
the
extraordinary
affair
at
Sidmouth
the
peculiar
species
Haploteuthis
ferox
was
known
to
science
only
generically
on
the
strength
of
a
halfdigested
tentacle
obtained
near
the
Azores
and
a
decaying
body
pecked
by
birds
and
nibbled
by
fish
found
early
in

by
Mr
Jennings
near
Lands
End
In
no
department
of
zoological
science
indeed
are
we
quite
so
much
in
the
dark
as
with
regard
to
the
deepsea
cephalopods
A
mere
accident
for
instance
it
was
that
led
to
the
Prince
of
Monacos
discovery
of
nearly
a
dozen
new
forms
in
the
summer
of

a
discovery
in
which
the
beforementioned
tentacle
was
included
It
chanced
that
a
cachalot
was
killed
off
Terceira
by
some
sperm
whalers
and
in
its
last
struggles
charged
almost
to
the
Princes
yacht
missed
it
rolled
under
and
died
within
twenty
yards
of
his
rudder
And
in
its
agony
it
threw
up
a
number
of
large
objects
which
the
Prince
dimly
perceiving
they
were
strange
and
important
was
by
a
happy
expedient
able
to
secure
before
they
sank
He
set
his
screws
in
motion
and
kept
them
circling
in
the
vortices
thus
created
until
a
boat
could
be
lowered
And
these
specimens
were
whole
cephalopods
and
fragments
of
cephalopods
some
of
gigantic
proportions
and
almost
all
of
them
unknown
to
science!
It
would
seem
indeed
that
these
large
and
agile
creatures
living
in
the
middle
depths
of
the
sea
must
to
a
large
extent
for
ever
remain
unknown
to
us
since
under
water
they
are
too
nimble
for
nets
and
it
is
only
by
such
rare
unlookedfor
accidents
that
specimens
can
be
obtained
In
the
case
of
Haploteuthis
ferox
for
instance
we
are
still
altogether
ignorant
of
its
habitat
as
ignorant
as
we
are
of
the
breedingground
of
the
herring
or
the
seaways
of
the
salmon
And
zoologists
are
altogether
at
a
loss
to
account
for
its
sudden
appearance
on
our
coast
Possibly
it
was
the
stress
of
a
hunger
migration
that
drove
it
hither
out
of
the
deep
But
it
will
be
perhaps
better
to
avoid
necessarily
inconclusive
discussion
and
to
proceed
at
once
with
our
narrative
The
first
human
being
to
set
eyes
upon
a
living
Haploteuthisthe
first
human
being
to
survive
that
is
for
there
can
be
little
doubt
now
that
the
wave
of
bathing
fatalities
and
boating
accidents
that
travelled
along
the
coast
of
Cornwall
and
Devon
in
early
May
was
due
to
this
causewas
a
retired
teadealer
of
the
name
of
Fison
who
was
stopping
at
a
Sidmouth
boardinghouse
It
was
in
the
afternoon
and
he
was
walking
along
the
cliff
path
between
Sidmouth
and
Ladram
Bay
The
cliffs
in
this
direction
are
very
high
but
down
the
red
face
of
them
in
one
place
a
kind
of
ladder
staircase
has
been
made
He
was
near
this
when
his
attention
was
attracted
by
what
at
first
he
thought
to
be
a
cluster
of
birds
struggling
over
a
fragment
of
food
that
caught
the
sunlight
and
glistened
pinkishwhite
The
tide
was
right
out
and
this
object
was
not
only
far
below
him
but
remote
across
a
broad
waste
of
rock
reefs
covered
with
dark
seaweed
and
interspersed
with
silvery
shining
tidal
pools
And
he
was
moreover
dazzled
by
the
brightness
of
the
further
water
In
a
minute
regarding
this
again
he
perceived
that
his
judgment
was
in
fault
for
over
this
struggle
circled
a
number
of
birds
jackdaws
and
gulls
for
the
most
part
the
latter
gleaming
blindingly
when
the
sunlight
smote
their
wings
and
they
seemed
minute
in
comparison
with
it
And
his
curiosity
was
perhaps
aroused
all
the
more
strongly
because
of
his
first
insufficient
explanations
As
he
had
nothing
better
to
do
than
amuse
himself
he
decided
to
make
this
object
whatever
it
was
the
goal
of
his
afternoon
walk
instead
of
Ladram
Bay
conceiving
it
might
perhaps
be
a
great
fish
of
some
sort
stranded
by
some
chance
and
flapping
about
in
its
distress
And
so
he
hurried
down
the
long
steep
ladder
stopping
at
intervals
of
thirty
feet
or
so
to
take
breath
and
scan
the
mysterious
movement
At
the
foot
of
the
cliff
he
was
of
course
nearer
his
object
than
he
had
been
but
on
the
other
hand
it
now
came
up
against
the
incandescent
sky
beneath
the
sun
so
as
to
seem
dark
and
indistinct
Whatever
was
pinkish
of
it
was
now
hidden
by
a
skerry
of
weedy
boulders
But
he
perceived
that
it
was
made
up
of
seven
rounded
bodies
distinct
or
connected
and
that
the
birds
kept
up
a
constant
croaking
and
screaming
but
seemed
afraid
to
approach
it
too
closely
Mr
Fison
torn
by
curiosity
began
picking
his
way
across
the
waveworn
rocks
and
finding
the
wet
seaweed
that
covered
them
thickly
rendered
them
extremely
slippery
he
stopped
removed
his
shoes
and
socks
and
coiled
his
trousers
above
his
knees
His
object
was
of
course
merely
to
avoid
stumbling
into
the
rocky
pools
about
him
and
perhaps
he
was
rather
glad
as
all
men
are
of
an
excuse
to
resume
even
for
a
moment
the
sensations
of
his
boyhood
At
anyrate
it
is
to
this
no
doubt
that
he
owes
his
life
He
approached
his
mark
with
all
the
assurance
which
the
absolute
security
of
this
country
against
all
forms
of
animal
life
gives
its
inhabitants
The
round
bodies
moved
to
and
fro
but
it
was
only
when
he
surmounted
the
skerry
of
boulders
I
have
mentioned
that
he
realised
the
horrible
nature
of
the
discovery
It
came
upon
him
with
some
suddenness
The
rounded
bodies
fell
apart
as
he
came
into
sight
over
the
ridge
and
displayed
the
pinkish
object
to
be
the
partially
devoured
body
of
a
human
being
but
whether
of
a
man
or
woman
he
was
unable
to
say
And
the
rounded
bodies
were
new
and
ghastlylooking
creatures
in
shape
somewhat
resembling
an
octopus
and
with
huge
and
very
long
and
flexible
tentacles
coiled
copiously
on
the
ground
The
skin
had
a
glistening
texture
unpleasant
to
see
like
shiny
leather
The
downward
bend
of
the
tentaclesurrounded
mouth
the
curious
excrescence
at
the
bend
the
tentacles
and
the
large
intelligent
eyes
gave
the
creatures
a
grotesque
suggestion
of
a
face
They
were
the
size
of
a
fairsized
swine
about
the
body
and
the
tentacles
seemed
to
him
to
be
many
feet
in
length
There
were
he
thinks
seven
or
eight
at
least
of
the
creatures
Twenty
yards
beyond
them
amid
the
surf
of
the
now
returning
tide
two
others
were
emerging
from
the
sea
Their
bodies
lay
flatly
on
the
rocks
and
their
eyes
regarded
him
with
evil
interest
but
it
does
not
appear
that
Mr
Fison
was
afraid
or
that
he
realised
that
he
was
in
any
danger
Possibly
his
confidence
is
to
be
ascribed
to
the
limpness
of
their
attitudes
But
he
was
horrified
of
course
and
intensely
excited
and
indignant
at
such
revolting
creatures
preying
upon
human
flesh
He
thought
they
had
chanced
upon
a
drowned
body
He
shouted
to
them
with
the
idea
of
driving
them
off
and
finding
they
did
not
budge
cast
about
him
picked
up
a
big
rounded
lump
of
rock
and
flung
it
at
one
And
then
slowly
uncoiling
their
tentacles
they
all
began
moving
towards
himcreeping
at
first
deliberately
and
making
a
soft
purring
sound
to
each
other
In
a
moment
Mr
Fison
realised
that
he
was
in
danger
He
shouted
again
threw
both
his
boots
and
started
off
with
a
leap
forthwith
Twenty
yards
off
he
stopped
and
faced
about
judging
them
slow
and
behold!
the
tentacles
of
their
leader
were
already
pouring
over
the
rocky
ridge
on
which
he
had
just
been
standing!
At
that
he
shouted
again
but
this
time
not
threatening
but
a
cry
of
dismay
and
began
jumping
striding
slipping
wading
across
the
uneven
expanse
between
him
and
the
beach
The
tall
red
cliffs
seemed
suddenly
at
a
vast
distance
and
he
saw
as
though
they
were
creatures
in
another
world
two
minute
workmen
engaged
in
the
repair
of
the
ladderway
and
little
suspecting
the
race
for
life
that
was
beginning
below
them
At
one
time
he
could
hear
the
creatures
splashing
in
the
pools
not
a
dozen
feet
behind
him
and
once
he
slipped
and
almost
fell
They
chased
him
to
the
very
foot
of
the
cliffs
and
desisted
only
when
he
had
been
joined
by
the
workmen
at
the
foot
of
the
ladderway
up
the
cliff
All
three
of
the
men
pelted
them
with
stones
for
a
time
and
then
hurried
to
the
cliff
top
and
along
the
path
towards
Sidmouth
to
secure
assistance
and
a
boat
and
to
rescue
the
desecrated
body
from
the
clutches
of
these
abominable
creatures
And
as
if
he
had
not
already
been
in
sufficient
peril
that
day
Mr
Fison
went
with
the
boat
to
point
out
the
exact
spot
of
his
adventure
As
the
tide
was
down
it
required
a
considerable
detour
to
reach
the
spot
and
when
at
last
they
came
off
the
ladderway
the
mangled
body
had
disappeared
The
water
was
now
running
in
submerging
first
one
slab
of
slimy
rock
and
then
another
and
the
four
men
in
the
boatthe
workmen
that
is
the
boatman
and
Mr
Fisonnow
turned
their
attention
from
the
bearings
off
shore
to
the
water
beneath
the
keel
At
first
they
could
see
little
below
them
save
a
dark
jungle
of
laminaria
with
an
occasional
darting
fish
Their
minds
were
set
on
adventure
and
they
expressed
their
disappointment
freely
But
presently
they
saw
one
of
the
monsters
swimming
through
the
water
seaward
with
a
curious
rolling
motion
that
suggested
to
Mr
Fison
the
spinning
roll
of
a
captive
balloon
Almost
immediately
after
the
waving
streamers
of
laminaria
were
extraordinarily
perturbed
parted
for
a
moment
and
three
of
these
beasts
became
darkly
visible
struggling
for
what
was
probably
some
fragment
of
the
drowned
man
In
a
moment
the
copious
olivegreen
ribbons
had
poured
again
over
this
writhing
group
At
that
all
four
men
greatly
excited
began
beating
the
water
with
oars
and
shouting
and
immediately
they
saw
a
tumultuous
movement
among
the
weeds
They
desisted
to
see
more
clearly
and
as
soon
as
the
water
was
smooth
they
saw
as
it
seemed
to
them
the
whole
sea
bottom
among
the
weeds
set
with
eyes
Ugly
swine!
cried
one
of
the
men
Why
theres
dozens!
And
forthwith
the
things
began
to
rise
through
the
water
about
them
Mr
Fison
has
since
described
to
the
writer
this
startling
eruption
out
of
the
waving
laminaria
meadows
To
him
it
seemed
to
occupy
a
considerable
time
but
it
is
probable
that
really
it
was
an
affair
of
a
few
seconds
only
For
a
time
nothing
but
eyes
and
then
he
speaks
of
tentacles
streaming
out
and
parting
the
weed
fronds
this
way
and
that
Then
these
things
growing
larger
until
at
last
the
bottom
was
hidden
by
their
intercoiling
forms
and
the
tips
of
tentacles
rose
darkly
here
and
there
into
the
air
above
the
swell
of
the
waters
One
came
up
boldly
to
the
side
of
the
boat
and
clinging
to
this
with
three
of
its
suckerset
tentacles
threw
four
others
over
the
gunwale
as
if
with
an
intention
either
of
oversetting
the
boat
or
of
clambering
into
it
Mr
Fison
at
once
caught
up
the
boathook
and
jabbing
furiously
at
the
soft
tentacles
forced
it
to
desist
He
was
struck
in
the
back
and
almost
pitched
overboard
by
the
boatman
who
was
using
his
oar
to
resist
a
similar
attack
on
the
other
side
of
the
boat
But
the
tentacles
on
either
side
at
once
relaxed
their
hold
at
this
slid
out
of
sight
and
splashed
into
the
water
Wed
better
get
out
of
this
said
Mr
Fison
who
was
trembling
violently
He
went
to
the
tiller
while
the
boatman
and
one
of
the
workmen
seated
themselves
and
began
rowing
The
other
workman
stood
up
in
the
fore
part
of
the
boat
with
the
boathook
ready
to
strike
any
more
tentacles
that
might
appear
Nothing
else
seems
to
have
been
said
Mr
Fison
had
expressed
the
common
feeling
beyond
amendment
In
a
hushed
scared
mood
with
faces
white
and
drawn
they
set
about
escaping
from
the
position
into
which
they
had
so
recklessly
blundered
But
the
oars
had
scarcely
dropped
into
the
water
before
dark
tapering
serpentine
ropes
had
bound
them
and
were
about
the
rudder
and
creeping
up
the
sides
of
the
boat
with
a
looping
motion
came
the
suckers
again
The
men
gripped
their
oars
and
pulled
but
it
was
like
trying
to
move
a
boat
in
a
floating
raft
of
weeds
Help
here!
cried
the
boatman
and
Mr
Fison
and
the
second
workman
rushed
to
help
lug
at
the
oar
Then
the
man
with
the
boathookhis
name
was
Ewan
or
Ewensprang
up
with
a
curse
and
began
striking
downward
over
the
side
as
far
as
he
could
reach
at
the
bank
of
tentacles
that
now
clustered
along
the
boats
bottom
And
at
the
same
time
the
two
rowers
stood
up
to
get
a
better
purchase
for
the
recovery
of
their
oars
The
boatman
handed
his
to
Mr
Fison
who
lugged
desperately
and
meanwhile
the
boatman
opened
a
big
claspknife
and
leaning
over
the
side
of
the
boat
began
hacking
at
the
spiring
arms
upon
the
oar
shaft
Mr
Fison
staggering
with
the
quivering
rocking
of
the
boat
his
teeth
set
his
breath
coming
short
and
the
veins
starting
on
his
hands
as
he
pulled
at
his
oar
suddenly
cast
his
eyes
seaward
And
there
not
fifty
yards
off
across
the
long
rollers
of
the
incoming
tide
was
a
large
boat
standing
in
towards
them
with
three
women
and
a
little
child
in
it
A
boatman
was
rowing
and
a
little
man
in
a
pinkribboned
straw
hat
and
whites
stood
in
the
stern
hailing
them
For
a
moment
of
course
Mr
Fison
thought
of
help
and
then
he
thought
of
the
child
He
abandoned
his
oar
forthwith
threw
up
his
arms
in
a
frantic
gesture
and
screamed
to
the
party
in
the
boat
to
keep
away
for
Gods
sake!
It
says
much
for
the
modesty
and
courage
of
Mr
Fison
that
he
does
not
seem
to
be
aware
that
there
was
any
quality
of
heroism
in
his
action
at
this
juncture
The
oar
he
had
abandoned
was
at
once
drawn
under
and
presently
reappeared
floating
about
twenty
yards
away
At
the
same
moment
Mr
Fison
felt
the
boat
under
him
lurch
violently
and
a
hoarse
scream
a
prolonged
cry
of
terror
from
Hill
the
boatman
caused
him
to
forget
the
party
of
excursionists
altogether
He
turned
and
saw
Hill
crouching
by
the
forward
rowlock
his
face
convulsed
with
terror
and
his
right
arm
over
the
side
and
drawn
tightly
down
He
gave
now
a
succession
of
short
sharp
cries
Oh!
oh!
oh!oh!
Mr
Fison
believes
that
he
must
have
been
hacking
at
the
tentacles
below
the
waterline
and
have
been
grasped
by
them
but
of
course
it
is
quite
impossible
to
say
now
certainly
what
had
happened
The
boat
was
heeling
over
so
that
the
gunwale
was
within
ten
inches
of
the
water
and
both
Ewan
and
the
other
labourer
were
striking
down
into
the
water
with
oar
and
boathook
on
either
side
of
Hills
arm
Mr
Fison
instinctively
placed
himself
to
counterpoise
them
Then
Hill
who
was
a
burly
powerful
man
made
a
strenuous
effort
and
rose
almost
to
a
standing
position
He
lifted
his
arm
indeed
clean
out
of
the
water
Hanging
to
it
was
a
complicated
tangle
of
brown
ropes
and
the
eyes
of
one
of
the
brutes
that
had
hold
of
him
glaring
straight
and
resolute
showed
momentarily
above
the
surface
The
boat
heeled
more
and
more
and
the
greenbrown
water
came
pouring
in
a
cascade
over
the
side
Then
Hill
slipped
and
fell
with
his
ribs
across
the
side
and
his
arm
and
the
mass
of
tentacles
about
it
splashed
back
into
the
water
He
rolled
over
his
boot
kicked
Mr
Fisons
knee
as
that
gentleman
rushed
forward
to
seize
him
and
in
another
moment
fresh
tentacles
had
whipped
about
his
waist
and
neck
and
after
a
brief
convulsive
struggle
in
which
the
boat
was
nearly
capsized
Hill
was
lugged
overboard
The
boat
righted
with
a
violent
jerk
that
all
but
sent
Mr
Fison
over
the
other
side
and
hid
the
struggle
in
the
water
from
his
eyes
He
stood
staggering
to
recover
his
balance
for
a
moment
and
as
he
did
so
he
became
aware
that
the
struggle
and
the
inflowing
tide
had
carried
them
close
upon
the
weedy
rocks
again
Not
four
yards
off
a
table
of
rock
still
rose
in
rhythmic
movements
above
the
inwash
of
the
tide
In
a
moment
Mr
Fison
seized
the
oar
from
Ewan
gave
one
vigorous
stroke
then
dropping
it
ran
to
the
bows
and
leapt
He
felt
his
feet
slide
over
the
rock
and
by
a
frantic
effort
leapt
again
towards
a
further
mass
He
stumbled
over
this
came
to
his
knees
and
rose
again
Look
out!
cried
someone
and
a
large
drab
body
struck
him
He
was
knocked
flat
into
a
tidal
pool
by
one
of
the
workmen
and
as
he
went
down
he
heard
smothered
choking
cries
that
he
believed
at
the
time
came
from
Hill
Then
he
found
himself
marvelling
at
the
shrillness
and
variety
of
Hills
voice
Someone
jumped
over
him
and
a
curving
rush
of
foamy
water
poured
over
him
and
passed
He
scrambled
to
his
feet
dripping
and
without
looking
seaward
ran
as
fast
as
his
terror
would
let
him
shoreward
Before
him
over
the
flat
space
of
scattered
rocks
stumbled
the
two
workmenone
a
dozen
yards
in
front
of
the
other
He
looked
over
his
shoulder
at
last
and
seeing
that
he
was
not
pursued
faced
about
He
was
astonished
From
the
moment
of
the
rising
of
the
cephalopods
out
of
the
water
he
had
been
acting
too
swiftly
to
fully
comprehend
his
actions
Now
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
he
had
suddenly
jumped
out
of
an
evil
dream
For
there
were
the
sky
cloudless
and
blazing
with
the
afternoon
sun
the
sea
weltering
under
its
pitiless
brightness
the
soft
creamy
foam
of
the
breaking
water
and
the
low
long
dark
ridges
of
rock
The
righted
boat
floated
rising
and
falling
gently
on
the
swell
about
a
dozen
yards
from
shore
Hill
and
the
monsters
all
the
stress
and
tumult
of
that
fierce
fight
for
life
had
vanished
as
though
they
had
never
been
Mr
Fisons
heart
was
beating
violently
he
was
throbbing
to
the
fingertips
and
his
breath
came
deep
There
was
something
missing
For
some
seconds
he
could
not
think
clearly
enough
what
this
might
be
Sun
sky
sea
rockswhat
was
it
Then
he
remembered
the
boatload
of
excursionists
It
had
vanished
He
wondered
whether
he
had
imagined
it
He
turned
and
saw
the
two
workmen
standing
side
by
side
under
the
projecting
masses
of
the
tall
pink
cliffs
He
hesitated
whether
he
should
make
one
last
attempt
to
save
the
man
Hill
His
physical
excitement
seemed
to
desert
him
suddenly
and
leave
him
aimless
and
helpless
He
turned
shoreward
stumbling
and
wading
towards
his
two
companions
He
looked
back
again
and
there
were
now
two
boats
floating
and
the
one
farthest
out
at
sea
pitched
clumsily
bottom
upward
So
it
was
Haploteuthis
ferox
made
its
appearance
upon
the
Devonshire
coast
So
far
this
has
been
its
most
serious
aggression
Mr
Fisons
account
taken
together
with
the
wave
of
boating
and
bathing
casualties
to
which
I
have
already
alluded
and
the
absence
of
fish
from
the
Cornish
coasts
that
year
points
clearly
to
a
shoal
of
these
voracious
deepsea
monsters
prowling
slowly
along
the
subtidal
coastline
Hunger
migration
has
I
know
been
suggested
as
the
force
that
drove
them
hither
but
for
my
own
part
I
prefer
to
believe
the
alternative
theory
of
Hemsley
Hemsley
holds
that
a
pack
or
shoal
of
these
creatures
may
have
become
enamoured
of
human
flesh
by
the
accident
of
a
foundered
ship
sinking
among
them
and
have
wandered
in
search
of
it
out
of
their
accustomed
zone
first
waylaying
and
following
ships
and
so
coming
to
our
shores
in
the
wake
of
the
Atlantic
traffic
But
to
discuss
Hemsleys
cogent
and
admirablystated
arguments
would
be
out
of
place
here
It
would
seem
that
the
appetites
of
the
shoal
were
satisfied
by
the
catch
of
eleven
peoplefor
so
far
as
can
be
ascertained
there
were
ten
people
in
the
second
boat
and
certainly
these
creatures
gave
no
further
signs
of
their
presence
off
Sidmouth
that
day
The
coast
between
Seaton
and
Budleigh
Salterton
was
patrolled
all
that
evening
and
night
by
four
Preventive
Service
boats
the
men
in
which
were
armed
with
harpoons
and
cutlasses
and
as
the
evening
advanced
a
number
of
more
or
less
similarly
equipped
expeditions
organised
by
private
individuals
joined
them
Mr
Fison
took
no
part
in
any
of
these
expeditions
About
midnight
excited
hails
were
heard
from
a
boat
about
a
couple
of
miles
out
at
sea
to
the
southeast
of
Sidmouth
and
a
lantern
was
seen
waving
in
a
strange
manner
to
and
fro
and
up
and
down
The
nearer
boats
at
once
hurried
towards
the
alarm
The
venturesome
occupants
of
the
boat
a
seaman
a
curate
and
two
schoolboys
had
actually
seen
the
monsters
passing
under
their
boat
The
creatures
it
seems
like
most
deepsea
organisms
were
phosphorescent
and
they
had
been
floating
five
fathoms
deep
or
so
like
creatures
of
moonshine
through
the
blackness
of
the
water
their
tentacles
retracted
and
as
if
asleep
rolling
over
and
over
and
moving
slowly
in
a
wedgelike
formation
towards
the
southeast
These
people
told
their
story
in
gesticulated
fragments
as
first
one
boat
drew
alongside
and
then
another
At
last
there
was
a
little
fleet
of
eight
or
nine
boats
collected
together
and
from
them
a
tumult
like
the
chatter
of
a
marketplace
rose
into
the
stillness
of
the
night
There
was
little
or
no
disposition
to
pursue
the
shoal
the
people
had
neither
weapons
nor
experience
for
such
a
dubious
chase
and
presentlyeven
with
a
certain
relief
it
may
bethe
boats
turned
shoreward
And
now
to
tell
what
is
perhaps
the
most
astonishing
fact
in
this
whole
astonishing
raid
We
have
not
the
slightest
knowledge
of
the
subsequent
movements
of
the
shoal
although
the
whole
southwest
coast
was
now
alert
for
it
But
it
may
perhaps
be
significant
that
a
cachalot
was
stranded
off
Sark
on
June

Two
weeks
and
three
days
after
this
Sidmouth
affair
a
living
Haploteuthis
came
ashore
on
Calais
sands
It
was
alive
because
several
witnesses
saw
its
tentacles
moving
in
a
convulsive
way
But
it
is
probable
that
it
was
dying
A
gentleman
named
Pouchet
obtained
a
rifle
and
shot
it
That
was
the
last
appearance
of
a
living
Haploteuthis
No
others
were
seen
on
the
French
coast
On
the
th
of
June
a
dead
body
almost
complete
was
washed
ashore
near
Torquay
and
a
few
days
later
a
boat
from
the
Marine
Biological
station
engaged
in
dredging
off
Plymouth
picked
up
a
rotting
specimen
slashed
deeply
with
a
cutlass
wound
How
the
former
specimen
had
come
by
its
death
it
is
impossible
to
say
And
on
the
last
day
of
June
Mr
Egbert
Caine
an
artist
bathing
near
Newlyn
threw
up
his
arms
shrieked
and
was
drawn
under
A
friend
bathing
with
him
made
no
attempt
to
save
him
but
swam
at
once
for
the
shore
This
is
the
last
fact
to
tell
of
this
extraordinary
raid
from
the
deeper
sea
Whether
it
is
really
the
last
of
these
horrible
creatures
it
is
as
yet
premature
to
say
But
it
is
believed
and
certainly
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
they
have
returned
now
and
returned
for
good
to
the
sunless
depths
of
the
middle
seas
out
of
which
they
have
so
strangely
and
so
mysteriously
arisen
POLLOCK
AND
THE
PORROH
MAN
It
was
in
a
swampy
village
on
the
lagoon
river
behind
the
Turner
Peninsula
that
Pollocks
first
encounter
with
the
Porroh
man
occurred
The
women
of
that
country
are
famous
for
their
good
looksthey
are
Gallinas
with
a
dash
of
European
blood
that
dates
from
the
days
of
Vasco
de
Gama
and
the
English
slavetraders
and
the
Porroh
man
too
was
possibly
inspired
by
a
faint
Caucasian
taint
in
his
composition
Its
a
curious
thing
to
think
that
some
of
us
may
have
distant
cousins
eating
men
on
Sherboro
Island
or
raiding
with
the
Sofas
At
anyrate
the
Porroh
man
stabbed
the
woman
to
the
heart
as
though
he
had
been
a
mere
lowclass
Italian
and
very
narrowly
missed
Pollock
But
Pollock
using
his
revolver
to
parry
the
lightning
stab
which
was
aimed
at
his
deltoid
muscle
sent
the
iron
dagger
flying
and
firing
hit
the
man
in
the
hand
He
fired
again
and
missed
knocking
a
sudden
window
out
of
the
wall
of
the
hut
The
Porroh
man
stooped
in
the
doorway
glancing
under
his
arm
at
Pollock
Pollock
caught
a
glimpse
of
his
inverted
face
in
the
sunlight
and
then
the
Englishman
was
alone
sick
and
trembling
with
the
excitement
of
the
affair
in
the
twilight
of
the
place
It
had
all
happened
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
read
about
it
The
woman
was
quite
dead
and
having
ascertained
this
Pollock
went
to
the
entrance
of
the
hut
and
looked
out
Things
outside
were
dazzling
bright
Half
a
dozen
of
the
porters
of
the
expedition
were
standing
up
in
a
group
near
the
green
huts
they
occupied
and
staring
towards
him
wondering
what
the
shots
might
signify
Behind
the
little
group
of
men
was
the
broad
stretch
of
black
fetid
mud
by
the
river
a
green
carpet
of
rafts
of
papyrus
and
watergrass
and
then
the
leaden
water
The
mangroves
beyond
the
stream
loomed
indistinctly
through
the
blue
haze
There
were
no
signs
of
excitement
in
the
squat
village
whose
fence
was
just
visible
above
the
canegrass
Pollock
came
out
of
the
hut
cautiously
and
walked
towards
the
river
looking
over
his
shoulder
at
intervals
But
the
Porroh
man
had
vanished
Pollock
clutched
his
revolver
nervously
in
his
hand
One
of
his
men
came
to
meet
him
and
as
he
came
pointed
to
the
bushes
behind
the
hut
in
which
the
Porroh
man
had
disappeared
Pollock
had
an
irritating
persuasion
of
having
made
an
absolute
fool
of
himself
he
felt
bitter
savage
at
the
turn
things
had
taken
At
the
same
time
he
would
have
to
tell
Waterhousethe
moral
exemplary
cautious
Waterhousewho
would
inevitably
take
the
matter
seriously
Pollock
cursed
bitterly
at
his
luck
at
Waterhouse
and
especially
at
the
West
Coast
of
Africa
He
felt
consummately
sick
of
the
expedition
And
in
the
back
of
his
mind
all
the
time
was
a
speculative
doubt
where
precisely
within
the
visible
horizon
the
Porroh
man
might
be
It
is
perhaps
rather
shocking
but
he
was
not
at
all
upset
by
the
murder
that
had
just
happened
He
had
seen
so
much
brutality
during
the
last
three
months
so
many
dead
women
burnt
huts
drying
skeletons
up
the
Kittam
River
in
the
wake
of
the
Sofa
cavalry
that
his
senses
were
blunted
What
disturbed
him
was
the
persuasion
that
this
business
was
only
beginning
He
swore
savagely
at
the
black
who
ventured
to
ask
a
question
and
went
on
into
the
tent
under
the
orangetrees
where
Waterhouse
was
lying
feeling
exasperatingly
like
a
boy
going
into
the
headmasters
study
Waterhouse
was
still
sleeping
off
the
effects
of
his
last
dose
of
chlorodyne
and
Pollock
sat
down
on
a
packingcase
beside
him
and
lighting
his
pipe
waited
for
him
to
awake
About
him
were
scattered
the
pots
and
weapons
Waterhouse
had
collected
from
the
Mendi
people
and
which
he
had
been
repacking
for
the
canoe
voyage
to
Sulyma
Presently
Waterhouse
woke
up
and
after
judicial
stretching
decided
he
was
all
right
again
Pollock
got
him
some
tea
Over
the
tea
the
incidents
of
the
afternoon
were
described
by
Pollock
after
some
preliminary
beating
about
the
bush
Waterhouse
took
the
matter
even
more
seriously
than
Pollock
had
anticipated
He
did
not
simply
disapprove
he
scolded
he
insulted
Youre
one
of
those
infernal
fools
who
think
a
black
man
isnt
a
human
being
he
said
I
cant
be
ill
a
day
without
you
must
get
into
some
dirty
scrape
or
other
This
is
the
third
time
in
a
month
that
you
have
come
crosswayson
with
a
native
and
this
time
youre
in
for
it
with
a
vengeance
Porroh
too!
Theyre
down
upon
you
enough
as
it
is
about
that
idol
you
wrote
your
silly
name
on
And
theyre
the
most
vindictive
devils
on
earth!
You
make
a
man
ashamed
of
civilisation
To
think
you
come
of
a
decent
family!
If
ever
I
cumber
myself
up
with
a
vicious
stupid
young
lout
like
you
again
Steady
on
now
snarled
Pollock
in
the
tone
that
always
exasperated
Waterhouse
steady
on
At
that
Waterhouse
became
speechless
He
jumped
to
his
feet
Look
here
Pollock
he
said
after
a
struggle
to
control
his
breath
You
must
go
home
I
wont
have
you
any
longer
Im
ill
enough
as
it
is
through
you
Keep
your
hair
on
said
Pollock
staring
in
front
of
him
Im
ready
enough
to
go
Waterhouse
became
calmer
again
He
sat
down
on
the
campstool
Very
well
he
said
I
dont
want
a
row
Pollock
you
know
but
its
confoundedly
annoying
to
have
ones
plans
put
out
by
this
kind
of
thing
Ill
come
to
Sulyma
with
you
and
see
you
safe
aboard
You
neednt
said
Pollock
I
can
go
alone
From
here
Not
far
said
Waterhouse
You
dont
understand
this
Porroh
business
How
should
I
know
she
belonged
to
a
Porroh
man
said
Pollock
bitterly
Well
she
did
said
Waterhouse
and
you
cant
undo
the
thing
Go
alone
indeed!
I
wonder
what
theyd
do
to
you
You
dont
seem
to
understand
that
this
Porroh
hokeypokey
rules
this
country
is
its
law
religion
constitution
medicine
magic
They
appoint
the
chiefs
The
Inquisition
at
its
best
couldnt
hold
a
candle
to
these
chaps
He
will
probably
set
Awajale
the
chief
here
on
to
us
Its
lucky
our
porters
are
Mendis
We
shall
have
to
shift
this
little
settlement
of
ours
Confound
you
Pollock!
And
of
course
you
must
go
and
miss
him
He
thought
and
his
thoughts
seemed
disagreeable
Presently
he
stood
up
and
took
his
rifle
Id
keep
close
for
a
bit
if
I
were
you
he
said
over
his
shoulder
as
he
went
out
Im
going
out
to
see
what
I
can
find
out
about
it
Pollock
remained
sitting
in
the
tent
meditating
I
was
meant
for
a
civilised
life
he
said
to
himself
regretfully
as
he
filled
his
pipe
The
sooner
I
get
back
to
London
or
Paris
the
better
for
me
His
eye
fell
on
the
sealed
case
in
which
Waterhouse
had
put
the
featherless
poisoned
arrows
they
had
bought
in
the
Mendi
country
I
wish
I
had
hit
the
beggar
somewhere
vital
said
Pollock
viciously
Waterhouse
came
back
after
a
long
interval
He
was
not
communicative
though
Pollock
asked
him
questions
enough
The
Porroh
man
it
seems
was
a
prominent
member
of
that
mystical
society
The
village
was
interested
but
not
threatening
No
doubt
the
witchdoctor
had
gone
into
the
bush
He
was
a
great
witchdoctor
Of
course
hes
up
to
something
said
Waterhouse
and
became
silent
But
what
can
he
do
asked
Pollock
unheeded
I
must
get
you
out
of
this
Theres
something
brewing
or
things
would
not
be
so
quiet
said
Waterhouse
after
a
gap
of
silence
Pollock
wanted
to
know
what
the
brew
might
be
Dancing
in
a
circle
of
skulls
said
Waterhouse
brewing
a
stink
in
a
copper
pot
Pollock
wanted
particulars
Waterhouse
was
vague
Pollock
pressing
At
last
Waterhouse
lost
his
temper
How
the
devil
should
I
know
he
said
to
Pollocks
twentieth
inquiry
what
the
Porroh
man
would
do
He
tried
to
kill
you
offhand
in
the
hut
Now
I
fancy
he
will
try
something
more
elaborate
But
youll
see
fast
enough
I
dont
want
to
help
unnerve
you
Its
probably
all
nonsense
That
night
as
they
were
sitting
at
their
fire
Pollock
again
tried
to
draw
Waterhouse
out
on
the
subject
of
Porroh
methods
Better
get
to
sleep
said
Waterhouse
when
Pollocks
bent
became
apparent
we
start
early
tomorrow
You
may
want
all
your
nerve
about
you
But
what
line
will
he
take
Cant
say
Theyre
versatile
people
They
know
a
lot
of
rum
dodges
Youd
better
get
that
copperdevil
Shakespear
to
talk
There
was
a
flash
and
a
heavy
bang
out
of
the
darkness
behind
the
huts
and
a
clay
bullet
came
whistling
close
to
Pollocks
head
This
at
least
was
crude
enough
The
blacks
and
halfbreeds
sitting
and
yarning
round
their
own
fire
jumped
up
and
someone
fired
into
the
dark
Better
go
into
one
of
the
huts
said
Waterhouse
quietly
still
sitting
unmoved
Pollock
stood
up
by
the
fire
and
drew
his
revolver
Fighting
at
least
he
was
not
afraid
of
But
a
man
in
the
dark
is
in
the
best
of
armour
Realising
the
wisdom
of
Waterhouses
advice
Pollock
went
into
the
tent
and
lay
down
there
What
little
sleep
he
had
was
disturbed
by
dreams
variegated
dreams
but
chiefly
of
the
Porroh
mans
face
upside
down
as
he
went
out
of
the
hut
and
looked
up
under
his
arm
It
was
odd
that
this
transitory
impression
should
have
stuck
so
firmly
in
Pollocks
memory
Moreover
he
was
troubled
by
queer
pains
in
his
limbs
In
the
white
haze
of
the
early
morning
as
they
were
loading
the
canoes
a
barbed
arrow
suddenly
appeared
quivering
in
the
ground
close
to
Pollocks
foot
The
boys
made
a
perfunctory
effort
to
clear
out
the
thicket
but
it
led
to
no
capture
After
these
two
occurrences
there
was
a
disposition
on
the
part
of
the
expedition
to
leave
Pollock
to
himself
and
Pollock
became
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
anxious
to
mingle
with
blacks
Waterhouse
took
one
canoe
and
Pollock
in
spite
of
a
friendly
desire
to
chat
with
Waterhouse
had
to
take
the
other
He
was
left
all
alone
in
the
front
part
of
the
canoe
and
he
had
the
greatest
trouble
to
make
the
menwho
did
not
love
himkeep
to
the
middle
of
the
river
a
clear
hundred
yards
or
more
from
either
shore
However
he
made
Shakespear
the
Freetown
halfbreed
come
up
to
his
own
end
of
the
canoe
and
tell
him
about
Porroh
which
Shakespear
failing
in
his
attempts
to
leave
Pollock
alone
presently
did
with
considerable
freedom
and
gusto
The
day
passed
The
canoe
glided
swiftly
along
the
ribbon
of
lagoon
water
between
the
drift
of
waterfigs
fallen
trees
papyrus
and
palmwine
palms
and
with
the
dark
mangrove
swamp
to
the
left
through
which
one
could
hear
now
and
then
the
roar
of
the
Atlantic
surf
Shakespear
told
in
his
soft
blurred
English
of
how
the
Porroh
could
cast
spells
how
men
withered
up
under
their
malice
how
they
could
send
dreams
and
devils
how
they
tormented
and
killed
the
sons
of
Ijibu
how
they
kidnapped
a
white
trader
from
Sulyma
who
had
maltreated
one
of
the
sect
and
how
his
body
looked
when
it
was
found
And
Pollock
after
each
narrative
cursed
under
his
breath
at
the
want
of
missionary
enterprise
that
allowed
such
things
to
be
and
at
the
inert
British
Government
that
ruled
over
this
dark
heathendom
of
Sierra
Leone
In
the
evening
they
came
to
the
Kasi
Lake
and
sent
a
score
of
crocodiles
lumbering
off
the
island
on
which
the
expedition
camped
for
the
night
The
next
day
they
reached
Sulyma
and
smelt
the
sea
breeze
but
Pollock
had
to
put
up
there
for
five
days
before
he
could
get
on
to
Freetown
Waterhouse
considering
him
to
be
comparatively
safe
here
and
within
the
pale
of
Freetown
influence
left
him
and
went
back
with
the
expedition
to
Gbemma
and
Pollock
became
very
friendly
with
Perera
the
only
resident
white
trader
at
Sulymaso
friendly
indeed
that
he
went
about
with
him
everywhere
Perera
was
a
little
Portuguese
Jew
who
had
lived
in
England
and
he
appreciated
the
Englishmans
friendliness
as
a
great
compliment
For
two
days
nothing
happened
out
of
the
ordinary
for
the
most
part
Pollock
and
Perera
played
Napthe
only
game
they
had
in
commonand
Pollock
got
into
debt
Then
on
the
second
evening
Pollock
had
a
disagreeable
intimation
of
the
arrival
of
the
Porroh
man
in
Sulyma
by
getting
a
fleshwound
in
the
shoulder
from
a
lump
of
filed
iron
It
was
a
long
shot
and
the
missile
had
nearly
spent
its
force
when
it
hit
him
Still
it
conveyed
its
message
plainly
enough
Pollock
sat
up
in
his
hammock
revolver
in
hand
all
that
night
and
next
morning
confided
to
some
extent
in
the
AngloPortuguese
Perera
took
the
matter
seriously
He
knew
the
local
customs
pretty
thoroughly
It
is
a
personal
question
you
must
know
It
is
revenge
And
of
course
he
is
hurried
by
your
leaving
de
country
None
of
de
natives
or
halfbreeds
will
interfere
wid
him
very
muchunless
you
make
it
wort
deir
while
If
you
come
upon
him
suddenly
you
might
shoot
him
But
den
he
might
shoot
you
Den
deres
disinfernal
magic
said
Perera
Of
course
I
dont
believe
in
itsuperstitionbut
still
its
not
nice
to
tink
dat
wherever
you
are
dere
is
a
black
man
who
spends
a
moonlight
night
now
and
den
adancing
about
a
fire
to
send
you
bad
dreams
Had
any
bad
dreams
Rather
said
Pollock
I
keep
on
seeing
the
beggars
head
upside
down
grinning
at
me
and
showing
all
his
teeth
as
he
did
in
the
hut
and
coming
close
up
to
me
and
then
going
ever
so
far
off
and
coming
back
Its
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
but
somehow
it
simply
paralyses
me
with
terror
in
my
sleep
Queer
thingsdreams
I
know
its
a
dream
all
the
time
and
I
cant
wake
up
from
it
Its
probably
only
fancy
said
Perera
Den
my
niggers
say
Porroh
men
can
send
snakes
Seen
any
snakes
lately
Only
one
I
killed
him
this
morning
on
the
floor
near
my
hammock
Almost
trod
on
him
as
I
got
up
Ah!
said
Perera
and
then
reassuringly
Of
course
it
is
acoincidence
Still
I
would
keep
my
eyes
open
Den
deres
pains
in
de
bones
I
thought
they
were
due
to
miasma
said
Pollock
Probably
dey
are
When
did
dey
begin
Then
Pollock
remembered
that
he
first
noticed
them
the
night
after
the
fight
in
the
hut
Its
my
opinion
he
dont
want
to
kill
you
said
Pereraat
least
not
yet
Ive
heard
deir
idea
is
to
scare
and
worry
a
man
wid
deir
spells
and
narrow
misses
and
rheumatic
pains
and
bad
dreams
and
all
dat
until
hes
sick
of
life
Of
course
its
all
talk
you
know
You
mustnt
worry
about
it
But
I
wonder
what
hell
be
up
to
next
I
shall
have
to
be
up
to
something
first
said
Pollock
staring
gloomily
at
the
greasy
cards
that
Perera
was
putting
on
the
table
It
dont
suit
my
dignity
to
be
followed
about
and
shot
at
and
blighted
in
this
way
I
wonder
if
Porroh
hokeypokey
upsets
your
luck
at
cards
He
looked
at
Perera
suspiciously
Very
likely
it
does
said
Perera
warmly
shuffling
Dey
are
wonderful
people
That
afternoon
Pollock
killed
two
snakes
in
his
hammock
and
there
was
also
an
extraordinary
increase
in
the
number
of
red
ants
that
swarmed
over
the
place
and
these
annoyances
put
him
in
a
fit
temper
to
talk
over
business
with
a
certain
Mendi
rough
he
had
interviewed
before
The
Mendi
rough
showed
Pollock
a
little
iron
dagger
and
demonstrated
where
one
struck
in
the
neck
in
a
way
that
made
Pollock
shiver
and
in
return
for
certain
considerations
Pollock
promised
him
a
doublebarrelled
gun
with
an
ornamental
lock
In
the
evening
as
Pollock
and
Perera
were
playing
cards
the
Mendi
rough
came
in
through
the
doorway
carrying
something
in
a
bloodsoaked
piece
of
native
cloth
Not
here!
said
Pollock
very
hurriedly
Not
here!
But
he
was
not
quick
enough
to
prevent
the
man
who
was
anxious
to
get
to
Pollocks
side
of
the
bargain
from
opening
the
cloth
and
throwing
the
head
of
the
Porroh
man
upon
the
table
It
bounded
from
there
on
to
the
floor
leaving
a
red
trail
on
the
cards
and
rolled
into
a
corner
where
it
came
to
rest
upside
down
but
glaring
hard
at
Pollock
Perera
jumped
up
as
the
thing
fell
among
the
cards
and
began
in
his
excitement
to
gabble
in
Portuguese
The
Mendi
was
bowing
with
the
red
cloth
in
his
hand
De
gun!
he
said
Pollock
stared
back
at
the
head
in
the
corner
It
bore
exactly
the
expression
it
had
in
his
dreams
Something
seemed
to
snap
in
his
own
brain
as
he
looked
at
it
Then
Perera
found
his
English
again
You
got
him
killed
he
said
You
did
not
kill
him
yourself
Why
should
I
said
Pollock
But
he
will
not
be
able
to
take
it
off
now!
Take
what
off
said
Pollock
And
all
dese
cards
are
spoiled!
What
do
you
mean
by
taking
off
said
Pollock
You
must
send
me
a
new
pack
from
Freetown
You
can
buy
dem
dere
Buttake
it
off
It
is
only
superstition
I
forgot
De
niggers
say
dat
if
de
witcheshe
was
a
witch
But
it
is
rubbish
You
must
make
de
Porroh
man
take
it
off
or
kill
him
yourself
It
is
very
silly
Pollock
swore
under
his
breath
still
staring
hard
at
the
head
in
the
corner
I
cant
stand
that
glare
he
said
Then
suddenly
he
rushed
at
the
thing
and
kicked
it
It
rolled
some
yards
or
so
and
came
to
rest
in
the
same
position
as
before
upside
down
and
looking
at
him
He
is
ugly
said
the
AngloPortuguese
Very
ugly
Dey
do
it
on
deir
faces
with
little
knives
Pollock
would
have
kicked
the
head
again
but
the
Mendi
man
touched
him
on
the
arm
De
gun
he
said
looking
nervously
at
the
head
Twoif
you
will
take
that
beastly
thing
away
said
Pollock
The
Mendi
shook
his
head
and
intimated
that
he
only
wanted
one
gun
now
due
to
him
and
for
which
he
would
be
obliged
Pollock
found
neither
cajolery
nor
bullying
any
good
with
him
Perera
had
a
gun
to
sell
at
a
profit
of
three
hundred
per
cent
and
with
that
the
man
presently
departed
Then
Pollocks
eyes
against
his
will
were
recalled
to
the
thing
on
the
floor
It
is
funny
dat
his
head
keeps
upside
down
said
Perera
with
an
uneasy
laugh
His
brains
must
be
heavy
like
de
weight
in
de
little
images
one
sees
dat
keep
always
upright
wid
lead
in
dem
You
will
take
him
wiv
you
when
you
go
presently
You
might
take
him
now
De
cards
are
all
spoilt
Dere
is
a
man
sell
dem
in
Freetown
De
room
is
in
a
filty
mess
as
it
is
You
should
have
killed
him
yourself
Pollock
pulled
himself
together
and
went
and
picked
up
the
head
He
would
hang
it
up
by
the
lamphook
in
the
middle
of
the
ceiling
of
his
room
and
dig
a
grave
for
it
at
once
He
was
under
the
impression
that
he
hung
it
up
by
the
hair
but
that
must
have
been
wrong
for
when
he
returned
for
it
it
was
hanging
by
the
neck
upside
down
He
buried
it
before
sunset
on
the
north
side
of
the
shed
he
occupied
so
that
he
should
not
have
to
pass
the
grave
after
dark
when
he
was
returning
from
Pereras
He
killed
two
snakes
before
he
went
to
sleep
In
the
darkest
part
of
the
night
he
awoke
with
a
start
and
heard
a
pattering
sound
and
something
scraping
on
the
floor
He
sat
up
noiselessly
and
felt
under
his
pillow
for
his
revolver
A
mumbling
growl
followed
and
Pollock
fired
at
the
sound
There
was
a
yelp
and
something
dark
passed
for
a
moment
across
the
hazy
blue
of
the
doorway
A
dog!
said
Pollock
lying
down
again
In
the
early
dawn
he
awoke
again
with
a
peculiar
sense
of
unrest
The
vague
pain
in
his
bones
had
returned
For
some
time
he
lay
watching
the
red
ants
that
were
swarming
over
the
ceiling
and
then
as
the
light
grew
brighter
he
looked
over
the
edge
of
his
hammock
and
saw
something
dark
on
the
floor
He
gave
such
a
violent
start
that
the
hammock
overset
and
flung
him
out
He
found
himself
lying
perhaps
a
yard
away
from
the
head
of
the
Porroh
man
It
had
been
disinterred
by
the
dog
and
the
nose
was
grievously
battered
Ants
and
flies
swarmed
over
it
By
an
odd
coincidence
it
was
still
upside
down
and
with
the
same
diabolical
expression
in
the
inverted
eyes
Pollock
sat
paralysed
and
stared
at
the
horror
for
some
time
Then
he
got
up
and
walked
round
itgiving
it
a
wide
berthand
out
of
the
shed
The
clear
light
of
the
sunrise
the
living
stir
of
vegetation
before
the
breath
of
the
dying
landbreeze
and
the
empty
grave
with
the
marks
of
the
dogs
paws
lightened
the
weight
upon
his
mind
a
little
He
told
Perera
of
the
business
as
though
it
was
a
jesta
jest
to
be
told
with
white
lips
You
should
not
have
frighten
de
dog
said
Perera
with
poorly
simulated
hilarity
The
next
two
days
until
the
steamer
came
were
spent
by
Pollock
in
making
a
more
effectual
disposition
of
his
possession
Overcoming
his
aversion
to
handling
the
thing
he
went
down
to
the
river
mouth
and
threw
it
into
the
seawater
but
by
some
miracle
it
escaped
the
crocodiles
and
was
cast
up
by
the
tide
on
the
mud
a
little
way
up
the
river
to
be
found
by
an
intelligent
Arab
halfbreed
and
offered
for
sale
to
Pollock
and
Perera
as
a
curiosity
just
on
the
edge
of
night
The
native
hung
about
in
the
brief
twilight
making
lower
and
lower
offers
and
at
last
getting
scared
in
some
way
by
the
evident
dread
these
wise
white
men
had
for
the
thing
went
off
and
passing
Pollocks
shed
threw
his
burden
in
there
for
Pollock
to
discover
in
the
morning
At
this
Pollock
got
into
a
kind
of
frenzy
He
would
burn
the
thing
He
went
out
straightway
into
the
dawn
and
had
constructed
a
big
pyre
of
brushwood
before
the
heat
of
the
day
He
was
interrupted
by
the
hooter
of
the
little
paddle
steamer
from
Monrovia
to
Bathurst
which
was
coming
through
the
gap
in
the
bar
Thank
Heaven!
said
Pollock
with
infinite
piety
when
the
meaning
of
the
sound
dawned
upon
him
With
trembling
hands
he
lit
his
pile
of
wood
hastily
threw
the
head
upon
it
and
went
away
to
pack
his
portmanteau
and
make
his
adieux
to
Perera
That
afternoon
with
a
sense
of
infinite
relief
Pollock
watched
the
flat
swampy
foreshore
of
Sulyma
grow
small
in
the
distance
The
gap
in
the
long
line
of
white
surge
became
narrower
and
narrower
It
seemed
to
be
closing
in
and
cutting
him
off
from
his
trouble
The
feeling
of
dread
and
worry
began
to
slip
from
him
bit
by
bit
At
Sulyma
belief
in
Porroh
malignity
and
Porroh
magic
had
been
in
the
air
his
sense
of
Porroh
had
been
vast
pervading
threatening
dreadful
Now
manifestly
the
domain
of
Porroh
was
only
a
little
place
a
little
black
band
between
the
sea
and
the
blue
cloudy
Mendi
uplands
Goodbye
Porroh!
said
Pollock
Goodbyecertainly
not
au
revoir
The
captain
of
the
steamer
came
and
leant
over
the
rail
beside
him
and
wished
him
goodevening
and
spat
at
the
froth
of
the
wake
in
token
of
friendly
ease
I
picked
up
a
rummy
curio
on
the
beach
this
go
said
the
captain
Its
a
thing
I
never
saw
done
this
side
of
Indy
before
What
might
that
be
said
Pollock
Pickled
ed
said
the
captain
What
said
Pollock
Edsmoked
Ed
of
one
of
these
Porroh
chaps
all
ornamented
with
knifecuts
Why!
Whats
up
Nothing
I
shouldnt
have
took
you
for
a
nervous
chap
Green
in
the
face
By
gosh!
youre
a
bad
sailor
All
right
eh
Lord
how
funny
you
went!
Well
this
ed
I
was
telling
you
of
is
a
bit
rum
in
a
way
Ive
got
it
along
with
some
snakes
in
a
jar
of
spirit
in
my
cabin
what
I
keeps
for
such
curios
and
Im
hanged
if
it
dont
float
upsy
down
Hullo!
Pollock
had
given
an
incoherent
cry
and
had
his
hands
in
his
hair
He
ran
towards
the
paddleboxes
with
a
halfformed
idea
of
jumping
into
the
sea
and
then
he
realised
his
position
and
turned
back
towards
the
captain
Here!
said
the
captain
Jack
Philips
just
keep
him
off
me!
Stand
off!
No
nearer
mister!
Whats
the
matter
with
you
Are
you
mad
Pollock
put
his
hand
to
his
head
It
was
no
good
explaining
I
believe
I
am
pretty
nearly
mad
at
times
he
said
Its
a
pain
I
have
here
Comes
suddenly
Youll
excuse
me
I
hope
He
was
white
and
in
a
perspiration
He
saw
suddenly
very
clearly
all
the
danger
he
ran
of
having
his
sanity
doubted
He
forced
himself
to
restore
the
captains
confidence
by
answering
his
sympathetic
inquiries
noting
his
suggestions
even
trying
a
spoonful
of
neat
brandy
in
his
cheek
and
that
matter
settled
asking
a
number
of
questions
about
the
captains
private
trade
in
curiosities
The
captain
described
the
head
in
detail
All
the
while
Pollock
was
struggling
to
keep
under
a
preposterous
persuasion
that
the
ship
was
as
transparent
as
glass
and
that
he
could
distinctly
see
the
inverted
face
looking
at
him
from
the
cabin
beneath
his
feet
Pollock
had
a
worse
time
almost
on
the
steamer
than
he
had
at
Sulyma
All
day
he
had
to
control
himself
in
spite
of
his
intense
perception
of
the
imminent
presence
of
that
horrible
head
that
was
overshadowing
his
mind
At
night
his
old
nightmare
returned
until
with
a
violent
effort
he
would
force
himself
awake
rigid
with
the
horror
of
it
and
with
the
ghost
of
a
hoarse
scream
in
his
throat
He
left
the
actual
head
behind
at
Bathurst
where
he
changed
ship
for
Teneriffe
but
not
his
dreams
nor
the
dull
ache
in
his
bones
At
Teneriffe
Pollock
transferred
to
a
Cape
liner
but
the
head
followed
him
He
gambled
he
tried
chess
he
even
read
books
but
he
knew
the
danger
of
drink
Yet
whenever
a
round
black
shadow
a
round
black
object
came
into
his
range
there
he
looked
for
the
head
andsaw
it
He
knew
clearly
enough
that
his
imagination
was
growing
traitor
to
him
and
yet
at
times
it
seemed
the
ship
he
sailed
in
his
fellowpassengers
the
sailors
the
wide
sea
was
all
part
of
a
filmy
phantasmagoria
that
hung
scarcely
veiling
it
between
him
and
a
horrible
real
world
Then
the
Porroh
man
thrusting
his
diabolical
face
through
that
curtain
was
the
one
real
and
undeniable
thing
At
that
he
would
get
up
and
touch
things
taste
something
gnaw
something
burn
his
hand
with
a
match
or
run
a
needle
into
himself
So
struggling
grimly
and
silently
with
his
excited
imagination
Pollock
reached
England
He
landed
at
Southampton
and
went
on
straight
from
Waterloo
to
his
bankers
in
Cornhill
in
a
cab
There
he
transacted
some
business
with
the
manager
in
a
private
room
and
all
the
while
the
head
hung
like
an
ornament
under
the
black
marble
mantel
and
dripped
upon
the
fender
He
could
hear
the
drops
fall
and
see
the
red
on
the
fender
A
pretty
fern
said
the
manager
following
his
eyes
But
it
makes
the
fender
rusty
Very
said
Pollock
a
very
pretty
fern
And
that
reminds
me
Can
you
recommend
me
a
physician
for
mind
troubles
Ive
got
a
littlewhat
is
ithallucination
The
head
laughed
savagely
wildly
Pollock
was
surprised
the
manager
did
not
notice
it
But
the
manager
only
stared
at
his
face
With
the
address
of
a
doctor
Pollock
presently
emerged
in
Cornhill
There
was
no
cab
in
sight
and
so
he
went
on
down
to
the
western
end
of
the
street
and
essayed
the
crossing
opposite
the
Mansion
House
The
crossing
is
hardly
easy
even
for
the
expert
Londoner
cabs
vans
carriages
mailcarts
omnibuses
go
by
in
one
incessant
stream
to
anyone
fresh
from
the
malarious
solitudes
of
Sierra
Leone
it
is
a
boiling
maddening
confusion
But
when
an
inverted
head
suddenly
comes
bouncing
like
an
indiarubber
ball
between
your
legs
leaving
distinct
smears
of
blood
every
time
it
touches
the
ground
you
can
scarcely
hope
to
avoid
an
accident
Pollock
lifted
his
feet
convulsively
to
avoid
it
and
then
kicked
at
the
thing
furiously
Then
something
hit
him
violently
in
the
back
and
a
hot
pain
ran
up
his
arm
He
had
been
hit
by
the
pole
of
an
omnibus
and
three
of
the
fingers
of
his
left
hand
smashed
by
the
hoof
of
one
of
the
horsesthe
very
fingers
as
it
happened
that
he
shot
from
the
Porroh
man
They
pulled
him
out
from
between
the
horses
legs
and
found
the
address
of
the
physician
in
his
crushed
hand
For
a
couple
of
days
Pollocks
sensations
were
full
of
the
sweet
pungent
smell
of
chloroform
of
painful
operations
that
caused
him
no
pain
of
lying
still
and
being
given
food
and
drink
Then
he
had
a
slight
fever
and
was
very
thirsty
and
his
old
nightmare
came
back
It
was
only
when
it
returned
that
he
noticed
it
had
left
him
for
a
day
If
my
skull
had
been
smashed
instead
of
my
fingers
it
might
have
gone
altogether
said
Pollock
staring
thoughtfully
at
the
dark
cushion
that
had
taken
on
for
the
time
the
shape
of
the
head
Pollock
at
the
first
opportunity
told
the
physician
of
his
mind
trouble
He
knew
clearly
that
he
must
go
mad
unless
something
should
intervene
to
save
him
He
explained
that
he
had
witnessed
a
decapitation
in
Dahomey
and
was
haunted
by
one
of
the
heads
Naturally
he
did
not
care
to
state
the
actual
facts
The
physician
looked
grave
Presently
he
spoke
hesitatingly
As
a
child
did
you
get
very
much
religious
training
Very
little
said
Pollock
A
shade
passed
over
the
physicians
face
I
dont
know
if
you
have
heard
of
the
miraculous
curesit
may
be
of
course
they
are
not
miraculousat
Lourdes
Faithhealing
will
hardly
suit
me
I
am
afraid
said
Pollock
with
his
eye
on
the
dark
cushion
The
head
distorted
its
scarred
features
in
an
abominable
grimace
The
physician
went
upon
a
new
track
Its
all
imagination
he
said
speaking
with
sudden
briskness
A
fair
case
for
faithhealing
anyhow
Your
nervous
system
has
run
down
youre
in
that
twilight
state
of
health
when
the
bogles
come
easiest
The
strong
impression
was
too
much
for
you
I
must
make
you
up
a
little
mixture
that
will
strengthen
your
nervous
systemespecially
your
brain
And
you
must
take
exercise
Im
no
good
for
faithhealing
said
Pollock
And
therefore
we
must
restore
tone
Go
in
search
of
stimulating
airScotland
Norway
the
Alps
Jericho
if
you
like
said
Pollockwhere
Naaman
went
However
so
soon
as
his
fingers
would
let
him
Pollock
made
a
gallant
attempt
to
follow
out
the
doctors
suggestion
It
was
now
November
He
tried
football
but
to
Pollock
the
game
consisted
in
kicking
a
furious
inverted
head
about
a
field
He
was
no
good
at
the
game
He
kicked
blindly
with
a
kind
of
horror
and
when
they
put
him
back
into
goal
and
the
ball
came
swooping
down
upon
him
he
suddenly
yelled
and
got
out
of
its
way
The
discreditable
stories
that
had
driven
him
from
England
to
wander
in
the
tropics
shut
him
off
from
any
but
mens
society
and
now
his
increasingly
strange
behaviour
made
even
his
man
friends
avoid
him
The
thing
was
no
longer
a
thing
of
the
eye
merely
it
gibbered
at
him
spoke
to
him
A
horrible
fear
came
upon
him
that
presently
when
he
took
hold
of
the
apparition
it
would
no
longer
become
some
mere
article
of
furniture
but
would
feel
like
a
real
dissevered
head
Alone
he
would
curse
at
the
thing
defy
it
entreat
it
once
or
twice
in
spite
of
his
grim
selfcontrol
he
addressed
it
in
the
presence
of
others
He
felt
the
growing
suspicion
in
the
eyes
of
the
people
that
watched
himhis
landlady
the
servant
his
man
One
day
early
in
December
his
cousin
Arnoldhis
next
of
kincame
to
see
him
and
draw
him
out
and
watch
his
sunken
yellow
face
with
narrow
eager
eyes
And
it
seemed
to
Pollock
that
the
hat
his
cousin
carried
in
his
hand
was
no
hat
at
all
but
a
Gorgon
head
that
glared
at
him
upside
down
and
fought
with
its
eyes
against
his
reason
However
he
was
still
resolute
to
see
the
matter
out
He
got
a
bicycle
and
riding
over
the
frosty
road
from
Wandsworth
to
Kingston
found
the
thing
rolling
along
at
his
side
and
leaving
a
dark
trail
behind
it
He
set
his
teeth
and
rode
faster
Then
suddenly
as
he
came
down
the
hill
towards
Richmond
Park
the
apparition
rolled
in
front
of
him
and
under
his
wheel
so
quickly
that
he
had
no
time
for
thought
and
turning
quickly
to
avoid
it
was
flung
violently
against
a
heap
of
stones
and
broke
his
left
wrist
The
end
came
on
Christmas
morning
All
night
he
had
been
in
a
fever
the
bandages
encircling
his
wrist
like
a
band
of
fire
his
dreams
more
vivid
and
terrible
than
ever
In
the
cold
colourless
uncertain
light
that
came
before
the
sunrise
he
sat
up
in
his
bed
and
saw
the
head
upon
the
bracket
in
the
place
of
the
bronze
jar
that
had
stood
there
overnight
I
know
that
is
a
bronze
jar
he
said
with
a
chill
doubt
at
his
heart
Presently
the
doubt
was
irresistible
He
got
out
of
bed
slowly
shivering
and
advanced
to
the
jar
with
his
hand
raised
Surely
he
would
see
now
his
imagination
had
deceived
him
recognise
the
distinctive
sheen
of
bronze
At
last
after
an
age
of
hesitation
his
fingers
came
down
on
the
patterned
cheek
of
the
head
He
withdrew
them
spasmodically
The
last
stage
was
reached
His
sense
of
touch
had
betrayed
him
Trembling
stumbling
against
the
bed
kicking
against
his
shoes
with
his
bare
feet
a
dark
confusion
eddying
round
him
he
groped
his
way
to
the
dressingtable
took
his
razor
from
the
drawer
and
sat
down
on
the
bed
with
this
in
his
hand
In
the
lookingglass
he
saw
his
own
face
colourless
haggard
full
of
the
ultimate
bitterness
of
despair
He
beheld
in
swift
succession
the
incidents
in
the
brief
tale
of
his
experience
His
wretched
home
his
still
more
wretched
schooldays
the
years
of
vicious
life
he
had
led
since
then
one
act
of
selfish
dishonour
leading
to
another
it
was
all
clear
and
pitiless
now
all
its
squalid
folly
in
the
cold
light
of
the
dawn
He
came
to
the
hut
to
the
fight
with
the
Porroh
man
to
the
retreat
down
the
river
to
Sulyma
to
the
Mendi
assassin
and
his
red
parcel
to
his
frantic
endeavours
to
destroy
the
head
to
the
growth
of
his
hallucination
It
was
a
hallucination!
He
knew
it
was
A
hallucination
merely
For
a
moment
he
snatched
at
hope
He
looked
away
from
the
glass
and
on
the
bracket
the
inverted
head
grinned
and
grimaced
at
him
With
the
stiff
fingers
of
his
bandaged
hand
he
felt
at
his
neck
for
the
throb
of
his
arteries
The
morning
was
very
cold
the
steel
blade
felt
like
ice
THE
RED
ROOM
I
can
assure
you
said
I
that
it
will
take
a
very
tangible
ghost
to
frighten
me
And
I
stood
up
before
the
fire
with
my
glass
in
my
hand
It
is
your
own
choosing
said
the
man
with
the
withered
arm
and
glanced
at
me
askance
Eightandtwenty
years
said
I
I
have
lived
and
never
a
ghost
have
I
seen
as
yet
The
old
woman
sat
staring
hard
into
the
fire
her
pale
eyes
wide
open
Ay
she
broke
in
and
eightandtwenty
years
you
have
lived
and
never
seen
the
likes
of
this
house
I
reckon
Theres
a
many
things
to
see
when
ones
still
but
eightandtwenty
She
swayed
her
head
slowly
from
side
to
side
A
many
things
to
see
and
sorrow
for
I
half
suspected
the
old
people
were
trying
to
enhance
the
spiritual
terrors
of
their
house
by
their
droning
insistence
I
put
down
my
empty
glass
on
the
table
and
looked
about
the
room
and
caught
a
glimpse
of
myself
abbreviated
and
broadened
to
an
impossible
sturdiness
in
the
queer
old
mirror
at
the
end
of
the
room
Well
I
said
if
I
see
anything
tonight
I
shall
be
so
much
the
wiser
For
I
come
to
the
business
with
an
open
mind
Its
your
own
choosing
said
the
man
with
the
withered
arm
once
more
I
heard
the
sound
of
a
stick
and
a
shambling
step
on
the
flags
in
the
passage
outside
and
the
door
creaked
on
its
hinges
as
a
second
old
man
entered
more
bent
more
wrinkled
more
aged
even
than
the
first
He
supported
himself
by
a
single
crutch
his
eyes
were
covered
by
a
shade
and
his
lower
lip
halfaverted
hung
pale
and
pink
from
his
decaying
yellow
teeth
He
made
straight
for
an
armchair
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
sat
down
clumsily
and
began
to
cough
The
man
with
the
withered
arm
gave
this
newcomer
a
short
glance
of
positive
dislike
the
old
woman
took
no
notice
of
his
arrival
but
remained
with
her
eyes
fixed
steadily
on
the
fire
I
saidits
your
own
choosing
said
the
man
with
the
withered
arm
when
the
coughing
had
ceased
for
a
while
Its
my
own
choosing
I
answered
The
man
with
the
shade
became
aware
of
my
presence
for
the
first
time
and
threw
his
head
back
for
a
moment
and
sideways
to
see
me
I
caught
a
momentary
glimpse
of
his
eyes
small
and
bright
and
inflamed
Then
he
began
to
cough
and
splutter
again
Why
dont
you
drink
said
the
man
with
the
withered
arm
pushing
the
beer
towards
him
The
man
with
the
shade
poured
out
a
glassful
with
a
shaky
arm
that
splashed
half
as
much
again
on
the
deal
table
A
monstrous
shadow
of
him
crouched
upon
the
wall
and
mocked
his
action
as
he
poured
and
drank
I
must
confess
I
had
scarce
expected
these
grotesque
custodians
There
is
to
my
mind
something
inhuman
in
senility
something
crouching
and
atavistic
the
human
qualities
seem
to
drop
from
old
people
insensibly
day
by
day
The
three
of
them
made
me
feel
uncomfortable
with
their
gaunt
silences
their
bent
carriage
their
evident
unfriendliness
to
me
and
to
one
another
If
said
I
you
will
show
me
to
this
haunted
room
of
yours
I
will
make
myself
comfortable
there
The
old
man
with
the
cough
jerked
his
head
back
so
suddenly
that
it
startled
me
and
shot
another
glance
of
his
red
eyes
at
me
from
under
the
shade
but
no
one
answered
me
I
waited
a
minute
glancing
from
one
to
the
other
If
I
said
a
little
louder
if
you
will
show
me
to
this
haunted
room
of
yours
I
will
relieve
you
from
the
task
of
entertaining
me
Theres
a
candle
on
the
slab
outside
the
door
said
the
man
with
the
withered
arm
looking
at
my
feet
as
he
addressed
me
But
if
you
go
to
the
red
room
tonight
This
night
of
all
nights!
said
the
old
woman
You
go
alone
Very
well
I
answered
And
which
way
do
I
go
You
go
along
the
passage
for
a
bit
said
he
until
you
come
to
a
door
and
through
that
is
a
spiral
staircase
and
halfway
up
that
is
a
landing
and
another
door
covered
with
baize
Go
through
that
and
down
the
long
corridor
to
the
end
and
the
red
room
is
on
your
left
up
the
steps
Have
I
got
that
right
I
said
and
repeated
his
directions
He
corrected
me
in
one
particular
And
are
you
really
going
said
the
man
with
the
shade
looking
at
me
again
for
the
third
time
with
that
queer
unnatural
tilting
of
the
face
This
night
of
all
nights!
said
the
old
woman
It
is
what
I
came
for
I
said
and
moved
towards
the
door
As
I
did
so
the
old
man
with
the
shade
rose
and
staggered
round
the
table
so
as
to
be
closer
to
the
others
and
to
the
fire
At
the
door
I
turned
and
looked
at
them
and
saw
they
were
all
close
together
dark
against
the
firelight
staring
at
me
over
their
shoulders
with
an
intent
expression
on
their
ancient
faces
Goodnight
I
said
setting
the
door
open
Its
your
own
choosing
said
the
man
with
the
withered
arm
I
left
the
door
wide
open
until
the
candle
was
well
alight
and
then
I
shut
them
in
and
walked
down
the
chilly
echoing
passage
I
must
confess
that
the
oddness
of
these
three
old
pensioners
in
whose
charge
her
ladyship
had
left
the
castle
and
the
deeptoned
oldfashioned
furniture
of
the
housekeepers
room
in
which
they
foregathered
affected
me
in
spite
of
my
efforts
to
keep
myself
at
a
matteroffact
phase
They
seemed
to
belong
to
another
age
an
older
age
an
age
when
things
spiritual
were
different
from
this
of
ours
less
certain
an
age
when
omens
and
witches
were
credible
and
ghosts
beyond
denying
Their
very
existence
was
spectral
the
cut
of
their
clothing
fashions
born
in
dead
brains
The
ornaments
and
conveniences
of
the
room
about
them
were
ghostlythe
thoughts
of
vanished
men
which
still
haunted
rather
than
participated
in
the
world
of
today
But
with
an
effort
I
sent
such
thoughts
to
the
rightabout
The
long
draughty
subterranean
passage
was
chilly
and
dusty
and
my
candle
flared
and
made
the
shadows
cower
and
quiver
The
echoes
rang
up
and
down
the
spiral
staircase
and
a
shadow
came
sweeping
up
after
me
and
one
fled
before
me
into
the
darkness
overhead
I
came
to
the
landing
and
stopped
there
for
a
moment
listening
to
a
rustling
that
I
fancied
I
heard
then
satisfied
of
the
absolute
silence
I
pushed
open
the
baizecovered
door
and
stood
in
the
corridor
The
effect
was
scarcely
what
I
expected
for
the
moonlight
coming
in
by
the
great
window
on
the
grand
staircase
picked
out
everything
in
vivid
black
shadow
or
silvery
illumination
Everything
was
in
its
place
the
house
might
have
been
deserted
on
the
yesterday
instead
of
eighteen
months
ago
There
were
candles
in
the
sockets
of
the
sconces
and
whatever
dust
had
gathered
on
the
carpets
or
upon
the
polished
flooring
was
distributed
so
evenly
as
to
be
invisible
in
the
moonlight
I
was
about
to
advance
and
stopped
abruptly
A
bronze
group
stood
upon
the
landing
hidden
from
me
by
the
corner
of
the
wall
but
its
shadow
fell
with
marvellous
distinctness
upon
the
white
panelling
and
gave
me
the
impression
of
someone
crouching
to
waylay
me
I
stood
rigid
for
half
a
minute
perhaps
Then
with
my
hand
in
the
pocket
that
held
my
revolver
I
advanced
only
to
discover
a
Ganymede
and
Eagle
glistening
in
the
moonlight
That
incident
for
a
time
restored
my
nerve
and
a
porcelain
Chinaman
on
a
buhl
table
whose
head
rocked
silently
as
I
passed
him
scarcely
startled
me
The
door
to
the
red
room
and
the
steps
up
to
it
were
in
a
shadowy
corner
I
moved
my
candle
from
side
to
side
in
order
to
see
clearly
the
nature
of
the
recess
in
which
I
stood
before
opening
the
door
Here
it
was
thought
I
that
my
predecessor
was
found
and
the
memory
of
that
story
gave
me
a
sudden
twinge
of
apprehension
I
glanced
over
my
shoulder
at
the
Ganymede
in
the
moonlight
and
opened
the
door
of
the
red
room
rather
hastily
with
my
face
half
turned
to
the
pallid
silence
of
the
landing
I
entered
closed
the
door
behind
me
at
once
turned
the
key
I
found
in
the
lock
within
and
stood
with
the
candle
held
aloft
surveying
the
scene
of
my
vigil
the
great
red
room
of
Lorraine
Castle
in
which
the
young
duke
had
died
Or
rather
in
which
he
had
begun
his
dying
for
he
had
opened
the
door
and
fallen
headlong
down
the
steps
I
had
just
ascended
That
had
been
the
end
of
his
vigil
of
his
gallant
attempt
to
conquer
the
ghostly
tradition
of
the
place
and
never
I
thought
had
apoplexy
better
served
the
ends
of
superstition
And
there
were
other
and
older
stories
that
clung
to
the
room
back
to
the
halfcredible
beginning
of
it
all
the
tale
of
a
timid
wife
and
the
tragic
end
that
came
to
her
husbands
jest
of
frightening
her
And
looking
around
that
large
shadowy
room
with
its
shadowy
window
bays
its
recesses
and
alcoves
one
could
well
understand
the
legends
that
had
sprouted
in
its
black
corners
its
germinating
darkness
My
candle
was
a
little
tongue
of
light
in
its
vastness
that
failed
to
pierce
the
opposite
end
of
the
room
and
left
an
ocean
of
mystery
and
suggestion
beyond
its
island
of
light
I
resolved
to
make
a
systematic
examination
of
the
place
at
once
and
dispel
the
fanciful
suggestions
of
its
obscurity
before
they
obtained
a
hold
upon
me
After
satisfying
myself
of
the
fastening
of
the
door
I
began
to
walk
about
the
room
peering
round
each
article
of
furniture
tucking
up
the
valances
of
the
bed
and
opening
its
curtains
wide
I
pulled
up
the
blinds
and
examined
the
fastenings
of
the
several
windows
before
closing
the
shutters
leant
forward
and
looked
up
the
blackness
of
the
wide
chimney
and
tapped
the
dark
oak
panelling
for
any
secret
opening
There
were
two
big
mirrors
in
the
room
each
with
a
pair
of
sconces
bearing
candles
and
on
the
mantelshelf
too
were
more
candles
in
china
candlesticks
All
these
I
lit
one
after
the
other
The
fire
was
laidan
unexpected
consideration
from
the
old
housekeeperand
I
lit
it
to
keep
down
any
disposition
to
shiver
and
when
it
was
burning
well
I
stood
round
with
my
back
to
it
and
regarded
the
room
again
I
had
pulled
up
a
chintzcovered
armchair
and
a
table
to
form
a
kind
of
barricade
before
me
and
on
this
lay
my
revolver
ready
to
hand
My
precise
examination
had
done
me
good
but
I
still
found
the
remoter
darkness
of
the
place
and
its
perfect
stillness
too
stimulating
for
the
imagination
The
echoing
of
the
stir
and
crackling
of
the
fire
was
no
sort
of
comfort
to
me
The
shadow
in
the
alcove
at
the
end
in
particular
had
that
undefinable
quality
of
a
presence
that
odd
suggestion
of
a
lurking
living
thing
that
comes
so
easily
in
silence
and
solitude
At
last
to
reassure
myself
I
walked
with
a
candle
into
it
and
satisfied
myself
that
there
was
nothing
tangible
there
I
stood
that
candle
upon
the
floor
of
the
alcove
and
left
it
in
that
position
By
this
time
I
was
in
a
state
of
considerable
nervous
tension
although
to
my
reason
there
was
no
adequate
cause
for
the
condition
My
mind
however
was
perfectly
clear
I
postulated
quite
unreservedly
that
nothing
supernatural
could
happen
and
to
pass
the
time
I
began
to
string
some
rhymes
together
Ingoldsby
fashion
of
the
original
legend
of
the
place
A
few
I
spoke
aloud
but
the
echoes
were
not
pleasant
For
the
same
reason
I
also
abandoned
after
a
time
a
conversation
with
myself
upon
the
impossibility
of
ghosts
and
haunting
My
mind
reverted
to
the
three
old
and
distorted
people
downstairs
and
I
tried
to
keep
it
upon
that
topic
The
sombre
reds
and
blacks
of
the
room
troubled
me
even
with
seven
candles
the
place
was
merely
dim
The
one
in
the
alcove
flared
in
a
draught
and
the
fireflickering
kept
the
shadows
and
penumbra
perpetually
shifting
and
stirring
Casting
about
for
a
remedy
I
recalled
the
candles
I
had
seen
in
the
passage
and
with
a
slight
effort
walked
out
into
the
moonlight
carrying
a
candle
and
leaving
the
door
open
and
presently
returned
with
as
many
as
ten
These
I
put
in
various
knickknacks
of
china
with
which
the
room
was
sparsely
adorned
lit
and
placed
where
the
shadows
had
lain
deepest
some
on
the
floor
some
in
the
window
recesses
until
at
last
my
seventeen
candles
were
so
arranged
that
not
an
inch
of
the
room
but
had
the
direct
light
of
at
least
one
of
them
It
occurred
to
me
that
when
the
ghost
came
I
could
warn
him
not
to
trip
over
them
The
room
was
now
quite
brightly
illuminated
There
was
something
very
cheery
and
reassuring
in
these
little
streaming
flames
and
snuffing
them
gave
me
an
occupation
and
afforded
a
reassuring
sense
of
the
passage
of
time
Even
with
that
however
the
brooding
expectation
of
the
vigil
weighed
heavily
upon
me
It
was
after
midnight
that
the
candle
in
the
alcove
suddenly
went
out
and
the
black
shadow
sprang
back
to
its
place
there
I
did
not
see
the
candle
go
out
I
simply
turned
and
saw
that
the
darkness
was
there
as
one
might
start
and
see
the
unexpected
presence
of
a
stranger
By
Jove!
said
I
aloud
that
draughts
a
strong
one!
and
taking
the
matches
from
the
table
I
walked
across
the
room
in
a
leisurely
manner
to
relight
the
corner
again
My
first
match
would
not
strike
and
as
I
succeeded
with
the
second
something
seemed
to
blink
on
the
wall
before
me
I
turned
my
head
involuntarily
and
saw
that
the
two
candles
on
the
little
table
by
the
fireplace
were
extinguished
I
rose
at
once
to
my
feet
Odd!
I
said
Did
I
do
that
myself
in
a
flash
of
absentmindedness
I
walked
back
relit
one
and
as
I
did
so
I
saw
the
candle
in
the
right
sconce
of
one
of
the
mirrors
wink
and
go
right
out
and
almost
immediately
its
companion
followed
it
There
was
no
mistake
about
it
The
flame
vanished
as
if
the
wicks
had
been
suddenly
nipped
between
a
finger
and
a
thumb
leaving
the
wick
neither
glowing
nor
smoking
but
black
While
I
stood
gaping
the
candle
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
went
out
and
the
shadows
seemed
to
take
another
step
towards
me
This
wont
do!
said
I
and
first
one
and
then
another
candle
on
the
mantelshelf
followed
Whats
up
I
cried
with
a
queer
high
note
getting
into
my
voice
somehow
At
that
the
candle
on
the
wardrobe
went
out
and
the
one
I
had
relit
in
the
alcove
followed
Steady
on!
I
said
These
candles
are
wanted
speaking
with
a
halfhysterical
facetiousness
and
scratching
away
at
a
match
the
while
for
the
mantel
candlesticks
My
hands
trembled
so
much
that
twice
I
missed
the
rough
paper
of
the
matchbox
As
the
mantel
emerged
from
darkness
again
two
candles
in
the
remoter
end
of
the
window
were
eclipsed
But
with
the
same
match
I
also
relit
the
larger
mirror
candles
and
those
on
the
floor
near
the
doorway
so
that
for
the
moment
I
seemed
to
gain
on
the
extinctions
But
then
in
a
volley
there
vanished
four
lights
at
once
in
different
corners
of
the
room
and
I
struck
another
match
in
quivering
haste
and
stood
hesitating
whither
to
take
it
As
I
stood
undecided
an
invisible
hand
seemed
to
sweep
out
the
two
candles
on
the
table
With
a
cry
of
terror
I
dashed
at
the
alcove
then
into
the
corner
and
then
into
the
window
relighting
three
as
two
more
vanished
by
the
fireplace
then
perceiving
a
better
way
I
dropped
the
matches
on
the
ironbound
deedbox
in
the
corner
and
caught
up
the
bedroom
candlestick
With
this
I
avoided
the
delay
of
striking
matches
but
for
all
that
the
steady
process
of
extinction
went
on
and
the
shadows
I
feared
and
fought
against
returned
and
crept
in
upon
me
first
a
step
gained
on
this
side
of
me
and
then
on
that
It
was
like
a
ragged
stormcloud
sweeping
out
the
stars
Now
and
then
one
returned
for
a
minute
and
was
lost
again
I
was
now
almost
frantic
with
the
horror
of
the
coming
darkness
and
my
selfpossession
deserted
me
I
leaped
panting
and
dishevelled
from
candle
to
candle
in
a
vain
struggle
against
that
remorseless
advance
I
bruised
myself
on
the
thigh
against
the
table
I
sent
a
chair
headlong
I
stumbled
and
fell
and
whisked
the
cloth
from
the
table
in
my
fall
My
candle
rolled
away
from
me
and
I
snatched
another
as
I
rose
Abruptly
this
was
blown
out
as
I
swung
it
off
the
table
by
the
wind
of
my
sudden
movement
and
immediately
the
two
remaining
candles
followed
But
there
was
light
still
in
the
room
a
red
light
that
staved
off
the
shadows
from
me
The
fire!
Of
course
I
could
still
thrust
my
candle
between
the
bars
and
relight
it!
I
turned
to
where
the
flames
were
still
dancing
between
the
glowing
coals
and
splashing
red
reflections
upon
the
furniture
made
two
steps
towards
the
grate
and
incontinently
the
flames
dwindled
and
vanished
the
glow
vanished
the
reflections
rushed
together
and
vanished
and
as
I
thrust
the
candle
between
the
bars
darkness
closed
upon
me
like
the
shutting
of
an
eye
wrapped
about
me
in
a
stifling
embrace
sealed
my
vision
and
crushed
the
last
vestiges
of
reason
from
my
brain
The
candle
fell
from
my
hand
I
flung
out
my
arms
in
a
vain
effort
to
thrust
that
ponderous
blackness
away
from
me
and
lifting
up
my
voice
screamed
with
all
my
mightonce
twice
thrice
Then
I
think
I
must
have
staggered
to
my
feet
I
know
I
thought
suddenly
of
the
moonlit
corridor
and
with
my
head
bowed
and
my
arms
over
my
face
made
a
run
for
the
door
But
I
had
forgotten
the
exact
position
of
the
door
and
struck
myself
heavily
against
the
corner
of
the
bed
I
staggered
back
turned
and
was
either
struck
or
struck
myself
against
some
other
bulky
furniture
I
have
a
vague
memory
of
battering
myself
thus
to
and
fro
in
the
darkness
of
a
cramped
struggle
and
of
my
own
wild
crying
as
I
darted
to
and
fro
of
a
heavy
blow
at
last
upon
my
forehead
a
horrible
sensation
of
falling
that
lasted
an
age
of
my
last
frantic
effort
to
keep
my
footing
and
then
I
remember
no
more





I
opened
my
eyes
in
daylight
My
head
was
roughly
bandaged
and
the
man
with
the
withered
arm
was
watching
my
face
I
looked
about
me
trying
to
remember
what
had
happened
and
for
a
space
I
could
not
recollect
I
rolled
my
eyes
into
the
corner
and
saw
the
old
woman
no
longer
abstracted
pouring
out
some
drops
of
medicine
from
a
little
blue
phial
into
a
glass
Where
am
I
I
asked
I
seem
to
remember
you
and
yet
I
cannot
remember
who
you
are
They
told
me
then
and
I
heard
of
the
haunted
Red
Room
as
one
who
hears
a
tale
We
found
you
at
dawn
said
he
and
there
was
blood
on
your
forehead
and
lips
It
was
very
slowly
I
recovered
my
memory
of
my
experience
You
believe
now
said
the
old
man
that
the
room
is
haunted
He
spoke
no
longer
as
one
who
greets
an
intruder
but
as
one
who
grieves
for
a
broken
friend
Yes
said
I
the
room
is
haunted
And
you
have
seen
it
And
we
who
have
lived
here
all
our
lives
have
never
set
eyes
upon
it
Because
we
have
never
dared
Tell
us
is
it
truly
the
old
earl
who
No
said
I
it
is
not
I
told
you
so
said
the
old
lady
with
the
glass
in
her
hand
It
is
his
poor
young
countess
who
was
frightened
It
is
not
I
said
There
is
neither
ghost
of
earl
nor
ghost
of
countess
in
that
room
there
is
no
ghost
there
at
all
but
worse
far
worse
Well
they
said
The
worst
of
all
the
things
that
haunt
poor
mortal
man
said
I
and
that
is
in
all
its
nakednessFear!
Fear
that
will
not
have
light
nor
sound
that
will
not
bear
with
reason
that
deafens
and
darkens
and
overwhelms
It
followed
me
through
the
corridor
it
fought
against
me
in
the
room
I
stopped
abruptly
There
was
an
interval
of
silence
My
hand
went
up
to
my
bandages
Then
the
man
with
the
shade
sighed
and
spoke
That
is
it
said
he
I
knew
that
was
it
A
Power
of
Darkness
To
put
such
a
curse
upon
a
woman!
It
lurks
there
always
You
can
feel
it
even
in
the
daytime
even
of
a
bright
summers
day
in
the
hangings
in
the
curtains
keeping
behind
you
however
you
face
about
In
the
dusk
it
creeps
along
the
corridor
and
follows
you
so
that
you
dare
not
turn
There
is
Fear
in
that
room
of
hersblack
Fear
and
there
will
beso
long
as
this
house
of
sin
endures
THE
CONE
The
night
was
hot
and
overcast
the
sky
redrimmed
with
the
lingering
sunset
of
midsummer
They
sat
at
the
open
window
trying
to
fancy
the
air
was
fresher
there
The
trees
and
shrubs
of
the
garden
stood
stiff
and
dark
beyond
in
the
roadway
a
gaslamp
burnt
bright
orange
against
the
hazy
blue
of
the
evening
Farther
were
the
three
lights
of
the
railway
signal
against
the
lowering
sky
The
man
and
woman
spoke
to
one
another
in
low
tones
He
does
not
suspect
said
the
man
a
little
nervously
Not
he
she
said
peevishly
as
though
that
too
irritated
her
He
thinks
of
nothing
but
the
works
and
the
prices
of
fuel
He
has
no
imagination
no
poetry
None
of
these
men
of
iron
have
he
said
sententiously
They
have
no
hearts
He
has
not
she
said
She
turned
her
discontented
face
towards
the
window
The
distant
sound
of
a
roaring
and
rushing
drew
nearer
and
grew
in
volume
the
house
quivered
one
heard
the
metallic
rattle
of
the
tender
As
the
train
passed
there
was
a
glare
of
light
above
the
cutting
and
a
driving
tumult
of
smoke
one
two
three
four
five
six
seven
eight
black
oblongseight
truckspassed
across
the
dim
grey
of
the
embankment
and
were
suddenly
extinguished
one
by
one
in
the
throat
of
the
tunnel
which
with
the
last
seemed
to
swallow
down
train
smoke
and
sound
in
one
abrupt
gulp
This
country
was
all
fresh
and
beautiful
once
he
said
and
nowit
is
Gehenna
Down
that
waynothing
but
potbanks
and
chimneys
belching
fire
and
dust
into
the
face
of
heaven
But
what
does
it
matter
An
end
comes
an
end
to
all
this
cruelty
Tomorrow
He
spoke
the
last
word
in
a
whisper
Tomorrow
she
said
speaking
in
a
whisper
too
and
still
staring
out
of
the
window
Dear!
he
said
putting
his
hand
on
hers
She
turned
with
a
start
and
their
eyes
searched
one
anothers
Hers
softened
to
his
gaze
My
dear
one!
she
said
and
then
It
seems
so
strangethat
you
should
have
come
into
my
life
like
thisto
open
She
paused
To
open
he
said
All
this
wonderful
worldshe
hesitated
and
spoke
still
more
softlythis
world
of
love
to
me
Then
suddenly
the
door
clicked
and
closed
They
turned
their
heads
and
he
started
violently
back
In
the
shadow
of
the
room
stood
a
great
shadowy
figuresilent
They
saw
the
face
dimly
in
the
halflight
with
unexpressive
dark
patches
under
the
penthouse
brows
Every
muscle
in
Rauts
body
suddenly
became
tense
When
could
the
door
have
opened
What
had
he
heard
Had
he
heard
all
What
had
he
seen
A
tumult
of
questions
The
newcomers
voice
came
at
last
after
a
pause
that
seemed
interminable
Well
he
said
I
was
afraid
I
had
missed
you
Horrocks
said
the
man
at
the
window
gripping
the
windowledge
with
his
hand
His
voice
was
unsteady
The
clumsy
figure
of
Horrocks
came
forward
out
of
the
shadow
He
made
no
answer
to
Rauts
remark
For
a
moment
he
stood
above
them
The
womans
heart
was
cold
within
her
I
told
Mr
Raut
it
was
just
possible
you
might
come
back
she
said
in
a
voice
that
never
quivered
Horrocks
still
silent
sat
down
abruptly
in
the
chair
by
her
little
worktable
His
big
hands
were
clenched
one
saw
now
the
fire
of
his
eyes
under
the
shadow
of
his
brows
He
was
trying
to
get
his
breath
His
eyes
went
from
the
woman
he
had
trusted
to
the
friend
he
had
trusted
and
then
back
to
the
woman
By
this
time
and
for
the
moment
all
three
half
understood
one
another
Yet
none
dared
say
a
word
to
ease
the
pentup
things
that
choked
them
It
was
the
husbands
voice
that
broke
the
silence
at
last
You
wanted
to
see
me
he
said
to
Raut
Raut
started
as
he
spoke
I
came
to
see
you
he
said
resolved
to
lie
to
the
last
Yes
said
Horrocks
You
promised
said
Raut
to
show
me
some
fine
effects
of
moonlight
and
smoke
I
promised
to
show
you
some
fine
effects
of
moonlight
and
smoke
repeated
Horrocks
in
a
colourless
voice
And
I
thought
I
might
catch
you
tonight
before
you
went
down
to
the
works
proceeded
Raut
and
come
with
you
There
was
another
pause
Did
the
man
mean
to
take
the
thing
coolly
Did
he
after
all
know
How
long
had
he
been
in
the
room
Yet
even
at
the
moment
when
they
heard
the
door
their
attitudes
Horrocks
glanced
at
the
profile
of
the
woman
shadowy
pallid
in
the
halflight
Then
he
glanced
at
Raut
and
seemed
to
recover
himself
suddenly
Of
course
he
said
I
promised
to
show
you
the
works
under
their
proper
dramatic
conditions
Its
odd
how
I
could
have
forgotten
If
I
am
troubling
youbegan
Raut
Horrocks
started
again
A
new
light
had
suddenly
come
into
the
sultry
gloom
of
his
eyes
Not
in
the
least
he
said
Have
you
been
telling
Mr
Raut
of
all
these
contrasts
of
flame
and
shadow
you
think
so
splendid
said
the
woman
turning
now
to
her
husband
for
the
first
time
her
confidence
creeping
back
again
her
voice
just
one
halfnote
too
high
That
dreadful
theory
of
yours
that
machinery
is
beautiful
and
everything
else
in
the
world
ugly
I
thought
he
would
not
spare
you
Mr
Raut
Its
his
great
theory
his
one
discovery
in
art
I
am
slow
to
make
discoveries
said
Horrocks
grimly
damping
her
suddenly
But
what
I
discover
He
stopped
Well
she
said
Nothing
and
suddenly
he
rose
to
his
feet
I
promised
to
show
you
the
works
he
said
to
Raut
and
put
his
big
clumsy
hand
on
his
friends
shoulder
And
you
are
ready
to
go
Quite
said
Raut
and
stood
up
also
There
was
another
pause
Each
of
them
peered
through
the
indistinctness
of
the
dusk
at
the
other
two
Horrocks
hand
still
rested
on
Rauts
shoulder
Raut
half
fancied
still
that
the
incident
was
trivial
after
all
But
Mrs
Horrocks
knew
her
husband
better
knew
that
grim
quiet
in
his
voice
and
the
confusion
in
her
mind
took
a
vague
shape
of
physical
evil
Very
well
said
Horrocks
and
dropping
his
hand
turned
towards
the
door
My
hat
Raut
looked
round
in
the
halflight
Thats
my
workbasket
said
Mrs
Horrocks
with
a
gust
of
hysterical
laughter
Their
hands
came
together
on
the
back
of
the
chair
Here
it
is!
he
said
She
had
an
impulse
to
warn
him
in
an
undertone
but
she
could
not
frame
a
word
Dont
go!
and
Beware
of
him!
struggled
in
her
mind
and
the
swift
moment
passed
Got
it
said
Horrocks
standing
with
the
door
half
open
Raut
stepped
towards
him
Better
say
goodbye
to
Mrs
Horrocks
said
the
ironmaster
even
more
grimly
quiet
in
his
tone
than
before
Raut
started
and
turned
Goodevening
Mrs
Horrocks
he
said
and
their
hands
touched
Horrocks
held
the
door
open
with
a
ceremonial
politeness
unusual
in
him
towards
men
Raut
went
out
and
then
after
a
wordless
look
at
her
her
husband
followed
She
stood
motionless
while
Rauts
light
footfall
and
her
husbands
heavy
tread
like
bass
and
treble
passed
down
the
passage
together
The
front
door
slammed
heavily
She
went
to
the
window
moving
slowly
and
stood
watchingleaning
forward
The
two
men
appeared
for
a
moment
at
the
gateway
in
the
road
passed
under
the
street
lamp
and
were
hidden
by
the
black
masses
of
the
shrubbery
The
lamplight
fell
for
a
moment
on
their
faces
showing
only
unmeaning
pale
patches
telling
nothing
of
what
she
still
feared
and
doubted
and
craved
vainly
to
know
Then
she
sank
down
into
a
crouching
attitude
in
the
big
armchair
her
eyes
wide
open
and
staring
out
at
the
red
lights
from
the
furnaces
that
flickered
in
the
sky
An
hour
after
she
was
still
there
her
attitude
scarcely
changed
The
oppressive
stillness
of
the
evening
weighed
heavily
upon
Raut
They
went
side
by
side
down
the
road
in
silence
and
in
silence
turned
into
the
cindermade
byway
that
presently
opened
out
the
prospect
of
the
valley
A
blue
haze
half
dust
half
mist
touched
the
long
valley
with
mystery
Beyond
were
Hanley
and
Etruria
grey
and
dark
masses
outlined
thinly
by
the
rare
golden
dots
of
the
street
lamps
and
here
and
there
a
gaslit
window
or
the
yellow
glare
of
some
lateworking
factory
or
crowded
publichouse
Out
of
the
masses
clear
and
slender
against
the
evening
sky
rose
a
multitude
of
tall
chimneys
many
of
them
reeking
a
few
smokeless
during
a
season
of
play
Here
and
there
a
pallid
patch
and
ghostly
stunted
beehive
shapes
showed
the
position
of
a
potbank
or
a
wheel
black
and
sharp
against
the
hot
lower
sky
marked
some
colliery
where
they
raise
the
iridescent
coal
of
the
place
Nearer
at
hand
was
the
broad
stretch
of
railway
and
half
invisible
trains
shunteda
steady
puffing
and
rumbling
with
every
run
a
ringing
concussion
and
a
rhythmic
series
of
impacts
and
a
passage
of
intermittent
puffs
of
white
steam
across
the
further
view
And
to
the
left
between
the
railway
and
the
dark
mass
of
the
low
hill
beyond
dominating
the
whole
view
colossal
inkyblack
and
crowned
with
smoke
and
fitful
flames
stood
the
great
cylinders
of
the
Jeddah
Company
Blast
Furnaces
the
central
edifices
of
the
big
ironworks
of
which
Horrocks
was
the
manager
They
stood
heavy
and
threatening
full
of
an
incessant
turmoil
of
flames
and
seething
molten
iron
and
about
the
feet
of
them
rattled
the
rollingmills
and
the
steamhammer
beat
heavily
and
splashed
the
white
iron
sparks
hither
and
thither
Even
as
they
looked
a
truckful
of
fuel
was
shot
into
one
of
the
giants
and
the
red
flames
gleamed
out
and
a
confusion
of
smoke
and
black
dust
came
boiling
upwards
towards
the
sky
Certainly
you
get
some
fine
effects
of
colour
with
your
furnaces
said
Raut
breaking
a
silence
that
had
become
apprehensive
Horrocks
grunted
He
stood
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
frowning
down
at
the
dim
steaming
railway
and
the
busy
ironworks
beyond
frowning
as
if
he
were
thinking
out
some
knotty
problem
Raut
glanced
at
him
and
away
again
At
present
your
moonlight
effect
is
hardly
ripe
he
continued
looking
upward
the
moon
is
still
smothered
by
the
vestiges
of
daylight
Horrocks
stared
at
him
with
the
expression
of
a
man
who
has
suddenly
awakened
Vestiges
of
daylight
Of
course
of
course
He
too
looked
up
at
the
moon
pale
still
in
the
midsummer
sky
Come
along
he
said
suddenly
and
gripping
Rauts
arm
in
his
hand
made
a
move
towards
the
path
that
dropped
from
them
to
the
railway
Raut
hung
back
Their
eyes
met
and
saw
a
thousand
things
in
a
moment
that
their
lips
came
near
to
say
Horrockss
hand
tightened
and
then
relaxed
He
let
go
and
before
Raut
was
aware
of
it
they
were
arm
in
arm
and
walking
one
unwillingly
enough
down
the
path
You
see
the
fine
effect
of
the
railway
signals
towards
Burslem
said
Horrocks
suddenly
breaking
into
loquacity
striding
fast
and
tightening
the
grip
of
his
elbow
the
while
Little
green
lights
and
red
and
white
lights
all
against
the
haze
You
have
an
eye
for
effect
Raut
Its
a
fine
effect
And
look
at
those
furnaces
of
mine
how
they
rise
upon
us
as
we
come
down
the
hill
That
to
the
right
is
my
petseventy
feet
of
him
I
packed
him
myself
and
hes
boiled
away
cheerfully
with
iron
in
his
guts
for
five
long
years
Ive
a
particular
fancy
for
him
That
line
of
red
therea
lovely
bit
of
warm
orange
youd
call
it
Rautthats
the
puddlers
furnaces
and
there
in
the
hot
light
three
black
figuresdid
you
see
the
white
splash
of
the
steamhammer
thenthats
the
rollingmills
Come
along!
Clang
clatter
how
it
goes
rattling
across
the
floor!
Sheet
tin
Rautamazing
stuff
Glass
mirrors
are
not
in
it
when
that
stuff
comes
from
the
mill
And
squelch!there
goes
the
hammer
again
Come
along!
He
had
to
stop
talking
to
catch
at
his
breath
His
arm
twisted
into
Rauts
with
benumbing
tightness
He
had
come
striding
down
the
black
path
towards
the
railway
as
though
he
was
possessed
Raut
had
not
spoken
a
word
had
simply
hung
back
against
Horrockss
pull
with
all
his
strength
I
say
he
said
now
laughing
nervously
but
with
an
undernote
of
snarl
in
his
voice
why
on
earth
are
you
nipping
my
arm
off
Horrocks
and
dragging
me
along
like
this
At
length
Horrocks
released
him
His
manner
changed
again
Nipping
your
arm
off
he
said
Sorry
But
its
you
taught
me
the
trick
of
walking
in
that
friendly
way
You
havent
learnt
the
refinements
of
it
yet
then
said
Raut
laughing
artificially
again
By
Jove!
Im
black
and
blue
Horrocks
offered
no
apology
They
stood
now
near
the
bottom
of
the
hill
close
to
the
fence
that
bordered
the
railway
The
ironworks
had
grown
larger
and
spread
out
with
their
approach
They
looked
up
to
the
blast
furnaces
now
instead
of
down
the
further
view
of
Etruria
and
Hanley
had
dropped
out
of
sight
with
their
descent
Before
them
by
the
stile
rose
a
noticeboard
bearing
still
dimly
visible
the
words
BEWARE
OF
THE
TRAINS
half
hidden
by
splashes
of
coaly
mud
Fine
effects
said
Horrocks
waving
his
arm
Here
comes
a
train
The
puffs
of
smoke
the
orange
glare
the
round
eye
of
light
in
front
of
it
the
melodious
rattle
Fine
effects!
But
these
furnaces
of
mine
used
to
be
finer
before
we
shoved
cones
in
their
throats
and
saved
the
gas
How
said
Raut
Cones
Cones
my
man
cones
Ill
show
you
one
nearer
The
flames
used
to
flare
out
of
the
open
throats
greatwhat
is
itpillars
of
cloud
by
day
red
and
black
smoke
and
pillars
of
fire
by
night
Now
we
run
it
off
in
pipes
and
burn
it
to
heat
the
blast
and
the
top
is
shut
by
a
cone
Youll
be
interested
in
that
cone
But
every
now
and
then
said
Raut
you
get
a
burst
of
fire
and
smoke
up
there
The
cones
not
fixed
its
hung
by
a
chain
from
a
lever
and
balanced
by
an
equipoise
You
shall
see
it
nearer
Else
of
course
thered
be
no
way
of
getting
fuel
into
the
thing
Every
now
and
then
the
cone
dips
and
out
comes
the
flare
I
see
said
Raut
He
looked
over
his
shoulder
The
moon
gets
brighter
he
said
Come
along
said
Horrocks
abruptly
gripping
his
shoulder
again
and
moving
him
suddenly
towards
the
railway
crossing
And
then
came
one
of
those
swift
incidents
vivid
but
so
rapid
that
they
leave
one
doubtful
and
reeling
Halfway
across
Horrockss
hand
suddenly
clenched
upon
him
like
a
vice
and
swung
him
backward
and
through
a
halfturn
so
that
he
looked
up
the
line
And
there
a
chain
of
lamplit
carriagewindows
telescoped
swiftly
as
it
came
towards
them
and
the
red
and
yellow
lights
of
an
engine
grew
larger
and
larger
rushing
down
upon
them
As
he
grasped
what
this
meant
he
turned
his
face
to
Horrocks
and
pushed
with
all
his
strength
against
the
arm
that
held
him
back
between
the
rails
The
struggle
did
not
last
a
moment
Just
as
certain
as
it
was
that
Horrocks
held
him
there
so
certain
was
it
that
he
had
been
violently
lugged
out
of
danger
Out
of
the
way
said
Horrocks
with
a
gasp
as
the
train
came
rattling
by
and
they
stood
panting
by
the
gate
into
the
ironworks
I
did
not
see
it
coming
said
Raut
still
even
in
spite
of
his
own
apprehensions
trying
to
keep
up
an
appearance
of
ordinary
intercourse
Horrocks
answered
with
a
grunt
The
cone
he
said
and
then
as
one
who
recovers
himself
I
thought
you
did
not
hear
I
didnt
said
Raut
I
wouldnt
have
had
you
run
over
then
for
the
world
said
Horrocks
For
a
moment
I
lost
my
nerve
said
Raut
Horrocks
stood
for
half
a
minute
then
turned
abruptly
towards
the
ironworks
again
See
how
fine
these
great
mounds
of
mine
these
clinkerheaps
look
in
the
night!
That
truck
yonder
up
above
there!
Up
it
goes
and
outtilts
the
slag
See
the
palpitating
red
stuff
go
sliding
down
the
slope
As
we
get
nearer
the
heap
rises
up
and
cuts
the
blast
furnaces
See
the
quiver
up
above
the
big
one
Not
that
way!
This
way
between
the
heaps
That
goes
to
the
puddling
furnaces
but
I
want
to
show
you
the
canal
first
He
came
and
took
Raut
by
the
elbow
and
so
they
went
along
side
by
side
Raut
answered
Horrocks
vaguely
What
he
asked
himself
had
really
happened
on
the
line
Was
he
deluding
himself
with
his
own
fancies
or
had
Horrocks
actually
held
him
back
in
the
way
of
the
train
Had
he
just
been
within
an
ace
of
being
murdered
Suppose
this
slouching
scowling
monster
did
know
anything
For
a
minute
or
two
then
Raut
was
really
afraid
for
his
life
but
the
mood
passed
as
he
reasoned
with
himself
After
all
Horrocks
might
have
heard
nothing
At
anyrate
he
had
pulled
him
out
of
the
way
in
time
His
odd
manner
might
be
due
to
the
mere
vague
jealousy
he
had
shown
once
before
He
was
talking
now
of
the
ashheaps
and
the
canal
Eigh
said
Horrocks
What
said
Raut
Rather!
The
haze
in
the
moonlight
Fine!
Our
canal
said
Horrocks
stopping
suddenly
Our
canal
by
moonlight
and
firelight
is
an
immense
effect
Youve
never
seen
it
Fancy
that!
Youve
spent
too
many
of
your
evenings
philandering
up
in
Newcastle
there
I
tell
you
for
real
florid
effects
But
you
shall
see
Boiling
water
As
they
came
out
of
the
labyrinth
of
clinkerheaps
and
mounds
of
coal
and
ore
the
noises
of
the
rollingmill
sprang
upon
them
suddenly
loud
near
and
distinct
Three
shadowy
workmen
went
by
and
touched
their
caps
to
Horrocks
Their
faces
were
vague
in
the
darkness
Raut
felt
a
futile
impulse
to
address
them
and
before
he
could
frame
his
words
they
passed
into
the
shadows
Horrocks
pointed
to
the
canal
close
before
them
now
a
weirdlooking
place
it
seemed
in
the
bloodred
reflections
of
the
furnaces
The
hot
water
that
cooled
the
res
came
into
it
some
fifty
yards
upa
tumultuous
almost
boiling
affluent
and
the
steam
rose
up
from
the
water
in
silent
white
wisps
and
streaks
wrapping
damply
about
them
an
incessant
succession
of
ghosts
coming
up
from
the
black
and
red
eddies
a
white
uprising
that
made
the
head
swim
The
shining
black
tower
of
the
larger
blastfurnace
rose
overhead
out
of
the
mist
and
its
tumultuous
riot
filled
their
ears
Raut
kept
away
from
the
edge
of
the
water
and
watched
Horrocks
Here
it
is
red
said
Horrocks
bloodred
vapour
as
red
and
hot
as
sin
but
yonder
there
where
the
moonlight
falls
on
it
and
it
drives
across
the
clinkerheaps
it
is
as
white
as
death
Raut
turned
his
head
for
a
moment
and
then
came
back
hastily
to
his
watch
on
Horrocks
Come
along
to
the
rollingmills
said
Horrocks
The
threatening
hold
was
not
so
evident
that
time
and
Raut
felt
a
little
reassured
But
all
the
same
what
on
earth
did
Horrocks
mean
about
white
as
death
and
red
as
sin
Coincidence
perhaps
They
went
and
stood
behind
the
puddlers
for
a
little
while
and
then
through
the
rollingmills
where
amidst
an
incessant
din
the
deliberate
steamhammer
beat
the
juice
out
of
the
succulent
iron
and
black
halfnaked
Titans
rushed
the
plastic
bars
like
hot
sealingwax
between
the
wheels
Come
on
said
Horrocks
in
Rauts
ear
and
they
went
and
peeped
through
the
little
glass
hole
behind
the
tuy
res
and
saw
the
tumbled
fire
writhing
in
the
pit
of
the
blastfurnace
It
left
one
eye
blinded
for
a
while
Then
with
green
and
blue
patches
dancing
across
the
dark
they
went
to
the
lift
by
which
the
trucks
of
ore
and
fuel
and
lime
were
raised
to
the
top
of
the
big
cylinder
And
out
upon
the
narrow
rail
that
overhung
the
furnace
Rauts
doubts
came
upon
him
again
Was
it
wise
to
be
here
If
Horrocks
did
knoweverything!
Do
what
he
would
he
could
not
resist
a
violent
trembling
Right
under
foot
was
a
sheer
depth
of
seventy
feet
It
was
a
dangerous
place
They
pushed
by
a
truck
of
fuel
to
get
to
the
railing
that
crowned
the
place
The
reek
of
the
furnace
a
sulphurous
vapour
streaked
with
pungent
bitterness
seemed
to
make
the
distant
hillside
of
Hanley
quiver
The
moon
was
riding
out
now
from
among
a
drift
of
clouds
halfway
up
the
sky
above
the
undulating
wooded
outlines
of
Newcastle
The
steaming
canal
ran
away
from
below
them
under
an
indistinct
bridge
and
vanished
into
the
dim
haze
of
the
flat
fields
towards
Burslem
Thats

Horrocks

the

of
the

through
it
like

Raut
gripped
the
handrail
tightly
and
stared
down
at
the
cone
The
heat
was
intense
The
boiling
of
the
iron
and
the
tumult
of
the
blast
made
a
thunderous
accompaniment
to
Horrockss
voice
But
the
thing
had
to
be
gone
through
now
Perhaps

said
Horrocks

Raut
and
turned
Boil

screamed
Raut
Let
go
my
arm!
With
one
hand
he
clutched
at
the
handrail
then
with
both
For
a
moment
the
two
men
stood
swaying
Then
suddenly
with
a
violent
jerk
Horrocks
had
twisted
him
from
his
hold
He
clutched
at
Horrocks
and
missed
his
foot
went
back
into
empty
air
in
midair
he
twisted
himself
and
then
cheek
and
shoulder
and
knee
struck
the
hot
cone
together
He
clutched
the
chain
by
which
the
cone
hung
and
the
thing
sank
an
infinitesimal
amount
as
he
struck
it
A
circle
of
glowing
red
appeared
about
him
and
a
tongue
of
flame
released
from
the
chaos
within
flickered
up
towards
him
An
intense
pain
assailed
him
at
the
knees
and
he
could
smell
the
singeing
of
his
hands
He
raised
himself
to
his
feet
and
tried
to
climb
up
the
chain
and
then
something
struck
his
head
Black
and
shining
with
the
moonlight
the
throat
of
the
furnace
rose
about
him
Horrocks
he
saw
stood
above
him
by
one
of
the
trucks
of
fuel
on
the
rail
The
gesticulating
figure
was
bright
and
white
in
the
moonlight
and
shouting
Fizzle
you
fool!
Fizzle
you
hunter
of
women!
You
hotblooded
hound!
Boil!
boil!
boil!
Suddenly
he
caught
up
a
handful
of
coal
out
of
the
truck
and
flung
it
deliberately
lump
after
lump
at
Raut
Horrocks!
cried
Raut
Horrocks!
He
clung
crying
to
the
chain
pulling
himself
up
from
the
burning
of
the
cone
Each
missile
Horrocks
flung
hit
him
His
clothes
charred
and
glowed
and
as
he
struggled
the
cone
dropped
and
a
rush
of
hot
suffocating
gas
whooped
out
and
burned
round
him
in
a
swift
breath
of
flame
His
human
likeness
departed
from
him
When
the
momentary
red
had
passed
Horrocks
saw
a
charred
blackened
figure
its
head
streaked
with
blood
still
clutching
and
fumbling
with
the
chain
and
writhing
in
agonya
cindery
animal
an
inhuman
monstrous
creature
that
began
a
sobbing
intermittent
shriek
Abruptly
at
the
sight
the
ironmasters
anger
passed
A
deadly
sickness
came
upon
him
The
heavy
odour
of
burning
flesh
came
drifting
up
to
his
nostrils
His
sanity
returned
to
him
God
have
mercy
upon
me!
he
cried
O
God!
what
have
I
done
He
knew
the
thing
below
him
save
that
it
still
moved
and
felt
was
already
a
dead
manthat
the
blood
of
the
poor
wretch
must
be
boiling
in
his
veins
An
intense
realisation
of
that
agony
came
to
his
mind
and
overcame
every
other
feeling
For
a
moment
he
stood
irresolute
and
then
turning
to
the
truck
he
hastily
tilted
its
contents
upon
the
struggling
thing
that
had
once
been
a
man
The
mass
fell
with
a
thud
and
went
radiating
over
the
cone
With
the
thud
the
shriek
ended
and
a
boiling
confusion
of
smoke
dust
and
flame
came
rushing
up
towards
him
As
it
passed
he
saw
the
cone
clear
again
Then
he
staggered
back
and
stood
trembling
clinging
to
the
rail
with
both
hands
His
lips
moved
but
no
words
came
to
them
Down
below
was
the
sound
of
voices
and
running
steps
The
clangour
of
rolling
in
the
shed
ceased
abruptly
THE
PURPLE
PILEUS
Mr
Coombes
was
sick
of
life
He
walked
away
from
his
unhappy
home
and
sick
not
only
of
his
own
existence
but
of
everybody
elses
turned
aside
down
Gaswork
Lane
to
avoid
the
town
and
crossing
the
wooden
bridge
that
goes
over
the
canal
to
Starlings
Cottages
was
presently
alone
in
the
damp
pinewoods
and
out
of
sight
and
sound
of
human
habitation
He
would
stand
it
no
longer
He
repeated
aloud
with
blasphemies
unusual
to
him
that
he
would
stand
it
no
longer
He
was
a
palefaced
little
man
with
dark
eyes
and
a
fine
and
very
black
moustache
He
had
a
very
stiff
upright
collar
slightly
frayed
that
gave
him
an
illusory
double
chin
and
his
overcoat
albeit
shabby
was
trimmed
with
astrachan
His
gloves
were
a
bright
brown
with
black
stripes
over
the
knuckles
and
split
at
the
finger
ends
His
appearance
his
wife
had
said
once
in
the
dear
dead
days
beyond
recallbefore
he
married
her
that
iswas
military
But
now
she
called
him
It
seems
a
dreadful
thing
to
tell
of
between
husband
and
wife
but
she
called
him
a
little
grub
It
wasnt
the
only
thing
she
had
called
him
either
The
row
had
arisen
about
that
beastly
Jennie
again
Jennie
was
his
wifes
friend
and
by
no
invitation
of
Mr
Coombes
she
came
in
every
blessed
Sunday
to
dinner
and
made
a
shindy
all
the
afternoon
She
was
a
big
noisy
girl
with
a
taste
for
loud
colours
and
a
strident
laugh
and
this
Sunday
she
had
outdone
all
her
previous
intrusions
by
bringing
in
a
fellow
with
her
a
chap
as
showy
as
herself
And
Mr
Coombes
in
a
starchy
clean
collar
and
his
Sunday
frockcoat
had
sat
dumb
and
wrathful
at
his
own
table
while
his
wife
and
her
guests
talked
foolishly
and
undesirably
and
laughed
aloud
Well
he
stood
that
and
after
dinner
which
as
usual
was
late
what
must
Miss
Jennie
do
but
go
to
the
piano
and
play
banjo
tunes
for
all
the
world
as
if
it
were
a
weekday!
Flesh
and
blood
could
not
endure
such
goings
on
They
would
hear
next
door
they
would
hear
in
the
road
it
was
a
public
announcement
of
their
disrepute
He
had
to
speak
He
had
felt
himself
go
pale
and
a
kind
of
rigour
had
affected
his
respiration
as
he
delivered
himself
He
had
been
sitting
on
one
of
the
chairs
by
the
windowthe
new
guest
had
taken
possession
of
the
armchair
He
turned
his
head
Sun
Day!
he
said
over
the
collar
in
the
voice
of
one
who
warns
Sun
Day!
What
people
call
a
nasty
tone
it
was
Jennie
had
kept
on
playing
but
his
wife
who
was
looking
through
some
music
that
was
piled
on
the
top
of
the
piano
had
stared
at
him
Whats
wrong
now
she
said
cant
people
enjoy
themselves
I
dont
mind
rational
njoyment
at
all
said
little
Coombes
but
I
aint
agoing
to
have
weekday
tunes
playing
on
a
Sunday
in
this
house
Whats
wrong
with
my
playing
now
said
Jennie
stopping
and
twirling
round
on
the
musicstool
with
a
monstrous
rustle
of
flounces
Coombes
saw
it
was
going
to
be
a
row
and
opened
too
vigorously
as
is
common
with
your
timid
nervous
men
all
the
world
over
Steady
on
with
that
musicstool!
said
he
it
aint
made
for
eavy
weights
Never
you
mind
about
weights
said
Jennie
incensed
What
was
you
saying
behind
my
back
about
my
playing
Surely
you
dont
old
with
not
having
a
bit
of
music
on
a
Sunday
Mr
Coombes
said
the
new
guest
leaning
back
in
the
armchair
blowing
a
cloud
of
cigarette
smoke
and
smiling
in
a
kind
of
pitying
way
And
simultaneously
his
wife
said
something
to
Jennie
about
Never
mind
im
You
go
on
Jinny
I
do
said
Mr
Coombes
addressing
the
new
guest
May
I
arst
why
said
the
new
guest
evidently
enjoying
both
his
cigarette
and
the
prospect
of
an
argument
He
was
by
the
bye
a
lank
young
man
very
stylishly
dressed
in
bright
drab
with
a
white
cravat
and
a
pearl
and
silver
pin
It
had
been
better
taste
to
come
in
a
black
coat
Mr
Coombes
thought
Because
began
Mr
Coombes
it
dont
suit
me
Im
a
business
man
I
ave
to
study
my
connection
Rational
njoyment
His
connection!
said
Mrs
Coombes
scornfully
Thats
what
hes
always
asaying
We
got
to
do
this
and
we
got
to
do
that
If
you
dont
mean
to
study
my
connection
said
Mr
Coombes
what
did
you
marry
me
for
I
wonder
said
Jennie
and
turned
back
to
the
piano
I
never
saw
such
a
man
as
you
said
Mrs
Coombes
Youve
altered
all
round
since
we
were
married
Before
Then
Jennie
began
at
the
tum
tum
tum
again
Look
here!
said
Mr
Coombes
driven
at
last
to
revolt
standing
up
and
raising
his
voice
I
tell
you
I
wont
have
that
The
frockcoat
heaved
with
his
indignation
No
vilence
now
said
the
long
young
man
in
drab
sitting
up
Who
the
juice
are
you
said
Mr
Coombes
fiercely
Whereupon
they
all
began
talking
at
once
The
new
guest
said
he
was
Jennies
intended
and
meant
to
protect
her
and
Mr
Coombes
said
he
was
welcome
to
do
so
anywhere
but
in
his
Mr
Coombes
house
and
Mrs
Coombes
said
he
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
insulting
his
guests
and
as
I
have
already
mentioned
that
he
was
getting
a
regular
little
grub
and
the
end
was
that
Mr
Coombes
ordered
his
visitors
out
of
the
house
and
they
wouldnt
go
and
so
he
said
he
would
go
himself
With
his
face
burning
and
tears
of
excitement
in
his
eyes
he
went
into
the
passage
and
as
he
struggled
with
his
overcoathis
frockcoat
sleeves
got
concertinaed
up
his
armand
gave
a
brush
at
his
silk
hat
Jennie
began
again
at
the
piano
and
strummed
him
insultingly
out
of
the
house
Tum
tum
tum
He
slammed
the
shop
door
so
that
the
house
quivered
That
briefly
was
the
immediate
making
of
his
mood
You
will
perhaps
begin
to
understand
his
disgust
with
existence
As
he
walked
along
the
muddy
path
under
the
firsit
was
late
October
and
the
ditches
and
heaps
of
fir
needles
were
gorgeous
with
clumps
of
fungihe
recapitulated
the
melancholy
history
of
his
marriage
It
was
brief
and
commonplace
enough
He
now
perceived
with
sufficient
clearness
that
his
wife
had
married
him
out
of
a
natural
curiosity
and
in
order
to
escape
from
her
worrying
laborious
and
uncertain
life
in
the
workroom
and
like
the
majority
of
her
class
she
was
far
too
stupid
to
realise
that
it
was
her
duty
to
cooperate
with
him
in
his
business
She
was
greedy
of
enjoyment
loquacious
and
sociallyminded
and
evidently
disappointed
to
find
the
restraints
of
poverty
still
hanging
about
her
His
worries
exasperated
her
and
the
slightest
attempt
to
control
her
proceedings
resulted
in
a
charge
of
grumbling
Why
couldnt
he
be
niceas
he
used
to
be
And
Coombes
was
such
a
harmless
little
man
too
nourished
mentally
on
SelfHelp
and
with
a
meagre
ambition
of
selfdenial
and
competition
that
was
to
end
in
a
sufficiency
Then
Jennie
came
in
as
a
female
Mephistopheles
a
gabbling
chronicle
of
fellers
and
was
always
wanting
his
wife
to
go
to
theatres
and
all
that
And
in
addition
were
aunts
of
his
wife
and
cousins
male
and
female
to
eat
up
capital
insult
him
personally
upset
business
arrangements
annoy
good
customers
and
generally
blight
his
life
It
was
not
the
first
occasion
by
many
that
Mr
Coombes
had
fled
his
home
in
wrath
and
indignation
and
something
like
fear
vowing
furiously
and
even
aloud
that
he
wouldnt
stand
it
and
so
frothing
away
his
energy
along
the
line
of
least
resistance
But
never
before
had
he
been
quite
so
sick
of
life
as
on
this
particular
Sunday
afternoon
The
Sunday
dinner
may
have
had
its
share
in
his
despairand
the
greyness
of
the
sky
Perhaps
too
he
was
beginning
to
realise
his
unendurable
frustration
as
a
business
man
as
the
consequence
of
his
marriage
Presently
bankruptcy
and
after
that
Perhaps
she
might
have
reason
to
repent
when
it
was
too
late
And
destiny
as
I
have
already
intimated
had
planted
the
path
through
the
wood
with
evilsmelling
fungi
thickly
and
variously
planted
it
not
only
on
the
right
side
but
on
the
left
A
small
shopman
is
in
such
a
melancholy
position
if
his
wife
turns
out
a
disloyal
partner
His
capital
is
all
tied
up
in
his
business
and
to
leave
her
means
to
join
the
unemployed
in
some
strange
part
of
the
earth
The
luxuries
of
divorce
are
beyond
him
altogether
So
that
the
good
old
tradition
of
marriage
for
better
or
worse
holds
inexorably
for
him
and
things
work
up
to
tragic
culminations
Bricklayers
kick
their
wives
to
death
and
dukes
betray
theirs
but
it
is
among
the
small
clerks
and
shopkeepers
nowadays
that
it
comes
most
often
to
a
cutting
of
throats
Under
the
circumstances
it
is
not
so
very
remarkableand
you
must
take
it
as
charitably
as
you
canthat
the
mind
of
Mr
Coombes
ran
for
a
while
on
some
such
glorious
close
to
his
disappointed
hopes
and
that
he
thought
of
razors
pistols
breadknives
and
touching
letters
to
the
coroner
denouncing
his
enemies
by
name
and
praying
piously
for
forgiveness
After
a
time
his
fierceness
gave
way
to
melancholia
He
had
been
married
in
this
very
overcoat
in
his
first
and
only
frockcoat
that
was
buttoned
up
beneath
it
He
began
to
recall
their
courting
along
this
very
walk
his
years
of
penurious
saving
to
get
capital
and
the
bright
hopefulness
of
his
marrying
days
For
it
all
to
work
out
like
this!
Was
there
no
sympathetic
ruler
anywhere
in
the
world
He
reverted
to
death
as
a
topic
He
thought
of
the
canal
he
had
just
crossed
and
doubted
whether
he
shouldnt
stand
with
his
head
out
even
in
the
middle
and
it
was
while
drowning
was
in
his
mind
that
the
purple
pileus
caught
his
eye
He
looked
at
it
mechanically
for
a
moment
and
stopped
and
stooped
towards
it
to
pick
it
up
under
the
impression
that
it
was
some
such
small
leather
object
as
a
purse
Then
he
saw
that
it
was
the
purple
top
of
a
fungus
a
peculiarly
poisonouslooking
purple
slimy
shiny
and
emitting
a
sour
odour
He
hesitated
with
his
hand
an
inch
or
so
from
it
and
the
thought
of
poison
crossed
his
mind
With
that
he
picked
the
thing
and
stood
up
again
with
it
in
his
hand
The
odour
was
certainly
strongacrid
but
by
no
means
disgusting
He
broke
off
a
piece
and
the
fresh
surface
was
a
creamy
white
that
changed
like
magic
in
the
space
of
ten
seconds
to
a
yellowishgreen
colour
It
was
even
an
invitinglooking
change
He
broke
off
two
other
pieces
to
see
it
repeated
They
were
wonderful
things
these
fungi
thought
Mr
Coombes
and
all
of
them
the
deadliest
poisons
as
his
father
had
often
told
him
Deadly
poisons!
There
is
no
time
like
the
present
for
a
rash
resolve
Why
not
here
and
now
thought
Mr
Coombes
He
tasted
a
little
piece
a
very
little
piece
indeeda
mere
crumb
It
was
so
pungent
that
he
almost
spat
it
out
again
then
merely
hot
and
fullflavoured
A
kind
of
German
mustard
with
a
touch
of
horseradish
andwell
mushroom
He
swallowed
it
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
Did
he
like
it
or
did
he
not
His
mind
was
curiously
careless
He
would
try
another
bit
It
really
wasnt
badit
was
good
He
forgot
his
troubles
in
the
interest
of
the
immediate
moment
Playing
with
death
it
was
He
took
another
bite
and
then
deliberately
finished
a
mouthful
A
curious
tingling
sensation
began
in
his
fingertips
and
toes
His
pulse
began
to
move
faster
The
blood
in
his
ears
sounded
like
a
millrace
Try
bi
more
said
Mr
Coombes
He
turned
and
looked
about
him
and
found
his
feet
unsteady
He
saw
and
struggled
towards
a
little
patch
of
purple
a
dozen
yards
away
Jol
goo
stuff
said
Mr
Coombes
Elomore
ye
He
pitched
forward
and
fell
on
his
face
his
hands
outstretched
towards
the
cluster
of
pilei
But
he
did
not
eat
any
more
of
them
He
forgot
forthwith
He
rolled
over
and
sat
up
with
a
look
of
astonishment
on
his
face
His
carefully
brushed
silk
hat
had
rolled
away
towards
the
ditch
He
pressed
his
hand
to
his
brow
Something
had
happened
but
he
could
not
rightly
determine
what
it
was
Anyhow
he
was
no
longer
dullhe
felt
bright
cheerful
And
his
throat
was
afire
He
laughed
in
the
sudden
gaiety
of
his
heart
Had
he
been
dull
He
did
not
know
but
at
anyrate
he
would
be
dull
no
longer
He
got
up
and
stood
unsteadily
regarding
the
universe
with
an
agreeable
smile
He
began
to
remember
He
could
not
remember
very
well
because
of
a
steam
roundabout
that
was
beginning
in
his
head
And
he
knew
he
had
been
disagreeable
at
home
just
because
they
wanted
to
be
happy
They
were
quite
right
life
should
be
as
gay
as
possible
He
would
go
home
and
make
it
up
and
reassure
them
And
why
not
take
some
of
this
delightful
toadstool
with
him
for
them
to
eat
A
hatful
no
less
Some
of
those
red
ones
with
white
spots
as
well
and
a
few
yellow
He
had
been
a
dull
dog
an
enemy
to
merriment
he
would
make
up
for
it
It
would
be
gay
to
turn
his
coatsleeves
inside
out
and
stick
some
yellow
gorse
into
his
waistcoat
pockets
Then
homesingingfor
a
jolly
evening





After
the
departure
of
Mr
Coombes
Jennie
discontinued
playing
and
turned
round
on
the
musicstool
again
What
a
fuss
about
nothing
said
Jennie
You
see
Mr
Clarence
what
Ive
got
to
put
up
with
said
Mrs
Coombes
He
is
a
bit
hasty
said
Mr
Clarence
judicially
He
aint
got
the
slightest
sense
of
our
position
said
Mrs
Coombes
thats
what
I
complain
of
He
cares
for
nothing
but
his
old
shop
and
if
I
have
a
bit
of
company
or
buy
anything
to
keep
myself
decent
or
get
any
little
thing
I
want
out
of
the
housekeeping
money
theres
disagreeables
Economy
he
says
struggle
for
life
and
all
that
He
lies
awake
of
nights
about
it
worrying
how
he
can
screw
me
out
of
a
shilling
He
wanted
us
to
eat
Dorset
butter
once
If
once
I
was
to
give
in
to
himthere!
Of
course
said
Jennie
If
a
man
values
a
woman
said
Mr
Clarence
lounging
back
in
the
armchair
he
must
be
prepared
to
make
sacrifices
for
her
For
my
own
part
said
Mr
Clarence
with
his
eye
on
Jennie
I
shouldnt
think
of
marrying
till
I
was
in
a
position
to
do
the
thing
in
style
Its
downright
selfishness
A
man
ought
to
go
through
the
roughandtumble
by
himself
and
not
drag
her
I
dont
agree
altogether
with
that
said
Jennie
I
dont
see
why
a
man
shouldnt
have
a
womans
help
provided
he
doesnt
treat
her
meanly
you
know
Its
meanness
You
wouldnt
believe
said
Mrs
Coombes
But
I
was
a
fool
to
ave
im
I
might
ave
known
If
it
adnt
been
for
my
father
we
shouldnt
have
had
not
a
carriage
to
our
wedding
Lord!
he
didnt
stick
out
at
that
said
Mr
Clarence
quite
shocked
Said
he
wanted
the
money
for
his
stock
or
some
such
rubbish
Why
he
wouldnt
have
a
woman
in
to
help
me
once
a
week
if
it
wasnt
for
my
standing
out
plucky
And
the
fusses
he
makes
about
moneycomes
to
me
well
pretty
near
crying
with
sheets
of
paper
and
figgers
If
only
we
can
tide
over
this
year
he
says
the
business
is
bound
to
go
If
only
we
can
tide
over
this
year
I
says
then
itll
be
if
only
we
can
tide
over
next
year
I
know
you
I
says
And
you
dont
catch
me
screwing
myself
lean
and
ugly
Why
didnt
you
marry
a
slavey
I
says
if
you
wanted
oneinstead
of
a
respectable
girl
I
says
So
Mrs
Coombes
But
we
will
not
follow
this
unedifying
conversation
further
Suffice
it
that
Mr
Coombes
was
very
satisfactorily
disposed
of
and
they
had
a
snug
little
time
round
the
fire
Then
Mrs
Coombes
went
to
get
the
tea
and
Jennie
sat
coquettishly
on
the
arm
of
Mr
Clarences
chair
until
the
teathings
clattered
outside
What
was
that
I
heard
asked
Mrs
Coombes
playfully
as
she
entered
and
there
was
badinage
about
kissing
They
were
just
sitting
down
to
the
little
circular
table
when
the
first
intimation
of
Mr
Coombes
return
was
heard
This
was
a
fumbling
at
the
latch
of
the
front
door
Eres
my
lord
said
Mrs
Coombes
Went
out
like
a
lion
and
comes
back
like
a
lamb
Ill
lay
Something
fell
over
in
the
shop
a
chair
it
sounded
like
Then
there
was
a
sound
as
of
some
complicated
step
exercise
in
the
passage
Then
the
door
opened
and
Coombes
appeared
But
it
was
Coombes
transfigured
The
immaculate
collar
had
been
torn
carelessly
from
his
throat
His
carefullybrushed
silk
hat
halffull
of
a
crush
of
fungi
was
under
one
arm
his
coat
was
inside
out
and
his
waistcoat
adorned
with
bunches
of
yellowblossomed
furze
These
little
eccentricities
of
Sunday
costume
however
were
quite
overshadowed
by
the
change
in
his
face
it
was
livid
white
his
eyes
were
unnaturally
large
and
bright
and
his
pale
blue
lips
were
drawn
back
in
a
cheerless
grin
Merry!
he
said
He
had
stopped
dancing
to
open
the
door
Rational
njoyment
Dance
He
made
three
fantastic
steps
into
the
room
and
stood
bowing
Jim!
shrieked
Mrs
Coombes
and
Mr
Clarence
sat
petrified
with
a
dropping
lower
jaw
Tea
said
Mr
Coombes
Jol
thing
tea
Tosestools
too
Brosher
Hes
drunk
said
Jennie
in
a
weak
voice
Never
before
had
she
seen
this
intense
pallor
in
a
drunken
man
or
such
shining
dilated
eyes
Mr
Coombes
held
out
a
handful
of
scarlet
agaric
to
Mr
Clarence
Jo
stuff
said
he
ta
some
At
that
moment
he
was
genial
Then
at
the
sight
of
their
startled
faces
he
changed
with
the
swift
transition
of
insanity
into
overbearing
fury
And
it
seemed
as
if
he
had
suddenly
recalled
the
quarrel
of
his
departure
In
such
a
huge
voice
as
Mrs
Coombes
had
never
heard
before
he
shouted
My
house
Im
master
ere
Eat
what
I
give
yer!
He
bawled
this
as
it
seemed
without
an
effort
without
a
violent
gesture
standing
there
as
motionless
as
one
who
whispers
holding
out
a
handful
of
fungus
Clarence
approved
himself
a
coward
He
could
not
meet
the
mad
fury
in
Coombes
eyes
he
rose
to
his
feet
pushing
back
his
chair
and
turned
stooping
At
that
Coombes
rushed
at
him
Jennie
saw
her
opportunity
and
with
the
ghost
of
a
shriek
made
for
the
door
Mrs
Coombes
followed
her
Clarence
tried
to
dodge
Over
went
the
teatable
with
a
smash
as
Coombes
clutched
him
by
the
collar
and
tried
to
thrust
the
fungus
into
his
mouth
Clarence
was
content
to
leave
his
collar
behind
him
and
shot
out
into
the
passage
with
red
patches
of
fly
agaric
still
adherent
to
his
face
Shut
im
in!
cried
Mrs
Coombes
and
would
have
closed
the
door
but
her
supports
deserted
her
Jennie
saw
the
shop
door
open
and
vanished
thereby
locking
it
behind
her
while
Clarence
went
on
hastily
into
the
kitchen
Mr
Coombes
came
heavily
against
the
door
and
Mrs
Coombes
finding
the
key
was
inside
fled
upstairs
and
locked
herself
in
the
spare
bedroom
So
the
new
convert
to
joie
de
vivre
emerged
upon
the
passage
his
decorations
a
little
scattered
but
that
respectable
hatful
of
fungi
still
under
his
arm
He
hesitated
at
the
three
ways
and
decided
on
the
kitchen
Whereupon
Clarence
who
was
fumbling
with
the
key
gave
up
the
attempt
to
imprison
his
host
and
fled
into
the
scullery
only
to
be
captured
before
he
could
open
the
door
into
the
yard
Mr
Clarence
is
singularly
reticent
of
the
details
of
what
occurred
It
seems
that
Mr
Coombes
transitory
irritation
had
vanished
again
and
he
was
once
more
a
genial
playfellow
And
as
there
were
knives
and
meat
choppers
about
Clarence
very
generously
resolved
to
humour
him
and
so
avoid
anything
tragic
It
is
beyond
dispute
that
Mr
Coombes
played
with
Mr
Clarence
to
his
hearts
content
they
could
not
have
been
more
playful
and
familiar
if
they
had
known
each
other
for
years
He
insisted
gaily
on
Clarence
trying
the
fungi
and
after
a
friendly
tussle
was
smitten
with
remorse
at
the
mess
he
was
making
of
his
guests
face
It
also
appears
that
Clarence
was
dragged
under
the
sink
and
his
face
scrubbed
with
the
blacking
brushhe
being
still
resolved
to
humour
the
lunatic
at
any
costand
that
finally
in
a
somewhat
dishevelled
chipped
and
discoloured
condition
he
was
assisted
to
his
coat
and
shown
out
by
the
back
door
the
shopway
being
barred
by
Jennie
Mr
Coombes
wandering
thoughts
then
turned
to
Jennie
Jennie
had
been
unable
to
unfasten
the
shop
door
but
she
shot
the
bolts
against
Mr
Coombes
latchkey
and
remained
in
possession
of
the
shop
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
It
would
appear
that
Mr
Coombes
then
returned
to
the
kitchen
still
in
pursuit
of
gaiety
and
albeit
a
strict
Good
Templar
drank
or
spilt
down
the
front
of
the
first
and
only
frockcoat
no
less
than
five
bottles
of
the
stout
Mrs
Coombes
insisted
upon
having
for
her
healths
sake
He
made
cheerful
noises
by
breaking
off
the
necks
of
the
bottles
with
several
of
his
wifes
weddingpresent
dinnerplates
and
during
the
earlier
part
of
this
great
drunk
he
sang
divers
merry
ballads
He
cut
his
finger
rather
badly
with
one
of
the
bottlesthe
only
bloodshed
in
this
storyand
what
with
that
and
the
systematic
convulsion
of
his
inexperienced
physiology
by
the
liquorish
brand
of
Mrs
Coombes
stout
it
may
be
the
evil
of
the
fungus
poison
was
somehow
allayed
But
we
prefer
to
draw
a
veil
over
the
concluding
incidents
of
this
Sunday
afternoon
They
ended
in
the
coal
cellar
in
a
deep
and
healing
sleep





An
interval
of
five
years
elapsed
Again
it
was
a
Sunday
afternoon
in
October
and
again
Mr
Coombes
walked
through
the
pinewood
beyond
the
canal
He
was
still
the
same
darkeyed
blackmoustached
little
man
that
he
was
at
the
outset
of
the
story
but
his
double
chin
was
now
scarcely
so
illusory
as
it
had
been
His
overcoat
was
new
with
a
velvet
lapel
and
a
stylish
collar
with
turndown
corners
free
of
any
coarse
starchiness
had
replaced
the
original
allround
article
His
hat
was
glossy
his
gloves
newishthough
one
finger
had
split
and
been
carefully
mended
And
a
casual
observer
would
have
noticed
about
him
a
certain
rectitude
of
bearing
a
certain
erectness
of
head
that
marks
the
man
who
thinks
well
of
himself
He
was
a
master
now
with
three
assistants
Beside
him
walked
a
larger
sunburnt
parody
of
himself
his
brother
Tom
just
back
from
Australia
They
were
recapitulating
their
early
struggles
and
Mr
Coombes
had
just
been
making
a
financial
statement
Its
a
very
nice
little
business
Jim
said
brother
Tom
In
these
days
of
competition
youre
jolly
lucky
to
have
worked
it
up
so
And
youre
jolly
lucky
too
to
have
a
wife
whos
willing
to
help
like
yours
does
Between
ourselves
said
Mr
Coombes
it
wasnt
always
so
It
wasnt
always
like
this
To
begin
with
the
missus
was
a
bit
giddy
Girls
are
funny
creatures
Dear
me!
Yes
Youd
hardly
think
it
but
she
was
downright
extravagant
and
always
having
slaps
at
me
I
was
a
bit
too
easy
and
loving
and
all
that
and
she
thought
the
whole
blessed
show
was
run
for
her
Turned
the
ouse
into
a
regular
caravansery
always
having
her
relations
and
girls
from
business
in
and
their
chaps
Comic
songs
a
Sunday
it
was
getting
to
and
driving
trade
away
And
she
was
making
eyes
at
the
chaps
too!
I
tell
you
Tom
the
place
wasnt
my
own
Shouldnt
a
thought
it
It
was
so
WellI
reasoned
with
her
I
said
I
aint
a
duke
to
keep
a
wife
like
a
pet
animal
I
married
you
for
elp
and
company
I
said
You
got
to
elp
and
pull
the
business
through
She
wouldnt
ear
of
it
Very
well
I
says
Im
a
mild
man
till
Im
roused
I
says
and
its
getting
to
that
But
she
wouldnt
ear
of
no
warnings
Well
Its
the
way
with
women
She
didnt
think
I
ad
it
in
me
to
be
roused
Women
of
her
sort
between
ourselves
Tom
dont
respect
a
man
until
theyre
a
bit
afraid
of
him
So
I
just
broke
out
to
show
her
In
comes
a
girl
named
Jennie
that
used
to
work
with
her
and
her
chap
We
ad
a
bit
of
a
row
and
I
came
out
ereit
was
just
such
another
day
as
thisand
I
thought
it
all
out
Then
I
went
back
and
pitched
into
them
You
did
I
did
I
was
mad
I
can
tell
you
I
wasnt
going
to
it
er
if
I
could
elp
it
so
I
went
back
and
licked
into
this
chap
just
to
show
er
what
I
could
do
E
was
a
big
chap
too
Well
I
chucked
him
and
smashed
things
about
and
gave
er
a
scaring
and
she
ran
up
and
locked
erself
into
the
spare
room
Well
Thats
all
I
says
to
er
the
next
morning
Now
you
know
I
says
what
Im
like
when
Im
roused
And
I
didnt
ave
to
say
anything
more
And
youve
been
happy
ever
after
eh
So
to
speak
Theres
nothing
like
putting
your
foot
down
with
them
If
it
adnt
been
for
that
afternoon
I
should
a
been
tramping
the
roads
now
and
shed
a
been
grumbling
at
me
and
all
her
family
grumbling
for
bringing
her
to
povertyI
know
their
little
ways
But
were
all
right
now
And
its
a
very
decent
little
business
as
you
say
They
proceed
on
their
way
meditatively
Women
are
funny
creatures
said
brother
Tom
They
want
a
firm
hand
says
Coombes
What
a
lot
of
these
funguses
there
are
about
here!
remarked
brother
Tom
presently
I
cant
see
what
use
they
are
in
the
world
Mr
Coombes
looked
I
dessay
theyre
sent
for
some
wise
purpose
said
Mr
Coombes
And
that
was
as
much
thanks
as
the
purple
pileus
ever
got
for
maddening
this
absurd
little
man
to
the
pitch
of
decisive
action
and
so
altering
the
whole
course
of
his
life
THE
JILTING
OF
JANE
As
I
sit
writing
in
my
study
I
can
hear
our
Jane
bumping
her
way
downstairs
with
a
brush
and
dustpan
She
used
in
the
old
days
to
sing
hymn
tunes
or
the
British
national
song
for
the
time
being
to
these
instruments
but
latterly
she
has
been
silent
and
even
careful
over
her
work
Time
was
when
I
prayed
with
fervour
for
such
silence
and
my
wife
with
sighs
for
such
care
but
now
they
have
come
we
are
not
so
glad
as
we
might
have
anticipated
we
should
be
Indeed
I
would
rejoice
secretly
though
it
may
be
unmanly
weakness
to
admit
it
even
to
hear
Jane
sing
Daisy
or
by
the
fracture
of
any
plate
but
one
of
Euphemias
best
green
ones
to
learn
that
the
period
of
brooding
has
come
to
an
end
Yet
how
we
longed
to
hear
the
last
of
Janes
young
man
before
we
heard
the
last
of
him!
Jane
was
always
very
free
with
her
conversation
to
my
wife
and
discoursed
admirably
in
the
kitchen
on
a
variety
of
topicsso
well
indeed
that
I
sometimes
left
my
study
door
openour
house
is
a
small
oneto
partake
of
it
But
after
William
came
it
was
always
William
nothing
but
William
William
this
and
William
that
and
when
we
thought
William
was
worked
out
and
exhausted
altogether
then
William
all
over
again
The
engagement
lasted
altogether
three
years
yet
how
she
got
introduced
to
William
and
so
became
thus
saturated
with
him
was
always
a
secret
For
my
part
I
believe
it
was
at
the
street
corner
where
the
Rev
Barnabas
Baux
used
to
hold
an
openair
service
after
evensong
on
Sundays
Young
Cupids
were
wont
to
flit
like
moths
round
the
paraffin
flare
of
that
centre
of
High
Church
hymnsinging
I
fancy
she
stood
singing
hymns
there
out
of
memory
and
her
imagination
instead
of
coming
home
to
get
supper
and
William
came
up
beside
her
and
said
Hello!
Hello
yourself!
she
said
and
etiquette
being
satisfied
they
proceeded
to
talk
together
As
Euphemia
has
a
reprehensible
way
of
letting
her
servants
talk
to
her
she
soon
heard
of
him
He
is
such
a
respectable
young
man
maam
said
Jane
you
dont
know
Ignoring
the
slur
cast
on
her
acquaintance
my
wife
inquired
further
about
this
William
He
is
second
porter
at
Maynards
the
drapers
said
Jane
and
gets
eighteen
shillingsnearly
a
pounda
week
mm
and
when
the
head
porter
leaves
he
will
be
head
porter
His
relatives
are
quite
superior
people
mm
Not
labouring
people
at
all
His
father
was
a
greengrosher
mm
and
had
a
chumor
and
he
was
bankrup
twice
And
one
of
his
sisters
is
in
a
Home
for
the
Dying
It
will
be
a
very
good
match
for
me
mm
said
Jane
me
being
an
orphan
girl
Then
you
are
engaged
to
him
asked
my
wife
Not
engaged
maam
but
he
is
saving
money
to
buy
a
ringhammyfist
Well
Jane
when
you
are
properly
engaged
to
him
you
may
ask
him
round
here
on
Sunday
afternoons
and
have
tea
with
him
in
the
kitchen
For
my
Euphemia
has
a
motherly
conception
of
her
duty
towards
her
maidservants
And
presently
the
amethystine
ring
was
being
worn
about
the
house
even
with
ostentation
and
Jane
developed
a
new
way
of
bringing
in
the
joint
so
that
this
gage
was
evident
The
elder
Miss
Maitland
was
aggrieved
by
it
and
told
my
wife
that
servants
ought
not
to
wear
rings
But
my
wife
looked
it
up
in
Enquire
Within
and
Mrs
Motherlys
Book
of
Household
Management
and
found
no
prohibition
So
Jane
remained
with
this
happiness
added
to
her
love
The
treasure
of
Janes
heart
appeared
to
me
to
be
what
respectable
people
call
a
very
deserving
young
man
William
maam
said
Jane
one
day
suddenly
with
illconcealed
complacency
as
she
counted
out
the
beer
bottles
William
maam
is
a
teetotaller
Yes
mm
and
he
dont
smoke
Smoking
maam
said
Jane
as
one
who
reads
the
heart
do
make
such
a
dust
about
Beside
the
waste
of
money
And
the
smell
However
I
suppose
its
necessary
to
some
Possibly
it
dawned
on
Jane
that
she
was
reflecting
a
little
severely
upon
Euphemias
comparative
illfortune
and
she
added
kindly
Im
sure
the
master
is
a
hangel
when
his
pipes
alight
Compared
to
other
times
William
was
at
first
a
rather
shabby
young
man
of
the
readymade
black
coat
school
of
costume
He
had
watery
grey
eyes
and
a
complexion
appropriate
to
the
brother
of
one
in
a
Home
for
the
Dying
Euphemia
did
not
fancy
him
very
much
even
at
the
beginning
His
eminent
respectability
was
vouched
for
by
an
alpaca
umbrella
from
which
he
never
allowed
himself
to
be
parted
He
goes
to
chapel
said
Jane
His
papa
maam
His
what
Jane
His
papa
maam
was
Church
but
Mr
Maynard
is
a
Plymouth
Brother
and
William
thinks
it
Policy
maam
to
go
there
too
Mr
Maynard
comes
and
talks
to
him
quite
friendly
when
they
aint
busy
about
using
up
all
the
ends
of
string
and
about
his
soul
He
takes
a
lot
of
notice
do
Mr
Maynard
of
William
and
the
way
he
saves
string
and
his
soul
maam
Presently
we
heard
that
the
head
porter
at
Maynards
had
left
and
that
William
was
head
porter
at
twentythree
shillings
a
week
He
is
really
kind
of
over
the
man
who
drives
the
van
said
Jane
and
him
married
with
three
children
And
she
promised
in
the
pride
of
her
heart
to
make
interest
for
us
with
William
to
favour
us
so
that
we
might
get
our
parcels
of
drapery
from
Maynards
with
exceptional
promptitude
After
this
promotion
a
rapidly
increasing
prosperity
came
upon
Janes
young
man
One
day
we
learned
that
Mr
Maynard
had
given
William
a
book
Smiles
Elp
Yourself
its
called
said
Jane
but
it
aint
comic
It
tells
you
how
to
get
on
in
the
world
and
some
what
William
read
to
me
was
lovely
maam
Euphemia
told
me
of
this
laughing
and
then
she
became
suddenly
grave
Do
you
know
dear
she
said
Jane
said
one
thing
I
did
not
like
She
had
been
quiet
for
a
minute
and
then
she
suddenly
remarked
William
is
a
lot
above
me
maam
aint
he
I
dont
see
anything
in
that
I
said
though
later
my
eyes
were
to
be
opened
One
Sunday
afternoon
about
that
time
I
was
sitting
at
my
writingdeskpossibly
I
was
reading
a
good
bookwhen
a
something
went
by
the
window
I
heard
a
startled
exclamation
behind
me
and
saw
Euphemia
with
her
hands
clasped
together
and
her
eyes
dilated
George
she
said
in
an
awestricken
whisper
did
you
see
Then
we
both
spoke
to
one
another
at
the
same
moment
slowly
and
solemnly
A
silk
hat!
Yellow
gloves!
A
new
umbrella!
It
may
be
my
fancy
dear
said
Euphemia
but
his
tie
was
very
like
yours
I
believe
Jane
keeps
him
in
ties
She
told
me
a
little
while
ago
in
a
way
that
implied
volumes
about
the
rest
of
your
costume
The
master
do
wear
pretty
ties
maam
And
he
echoes
all
your
novelties
The
young
couple
passed
our
window
again
on
their
way
to
their
customary
walk
They
were
arm
in
arm
Jane
looked
exquisitely
proud
happy
and
uncomfortable
with
new
white
cotton
gloves
and
William
in
the
silk
hat
singularly
genteel!
That
was
the
culmination
of
Janes
happiness
When
she
returned
Mr
Maynard
has
been
talking
to
William
maam
she
said
and
he
is
to
serve
customers
just
like
the
young
shop
gentlemen
during
the
next
sale
And
if
he
gets
on
he
is
to
be
made
an
assistant
maam
at
the
first
opportunity
He
has
got
to
be
as
gentlemanly
as
he
can
maam
and
if
he
aint
maam
he
says
it
wont
be
for
want
of
trying
Mr
Maynard
has
took
a
great
fancy
to
him
He
is
getting
on
Jane
said
my
wife
Yes
maam
said
Jane
thoughtfully
he
is
getting
on
And
she
sighed
That
next
Sunday
as
I
drank
my
tea
I
interrogated
my
wife
How
is
this
Sunday
different
from
all
other
Sundays
little
woman
What
has
happened
Have
you
altered
the
curtains
or
rearranged
the
furniture
or
where
is
the
indefinable
difference
of
it
Are
you
wearing
your
hair
in
a
new
way
without
warning
me
I
clearly
perceive
a
change
in
my
environment
and
I
cannot
for
the
life
of
me
say
what
it
is
Then
my
wife
answered
in
her
most
tragic
voice
George
she
said
thatthat
William
has
not
come
near
the
place
today!
And
Jane
is
crying
her
heart
out
upstairs
There
followed
a
period
of
silence
Jane
as
I
have
said
stopped
singing
about
the
house
and
began
to
care
for
our
brittle
possessions
which
struck
my
wife
as
being
a
very
sad
sign
indeed
The
next
Sunday
and
the
next
Jane
asked
to
go
out
to
walk
with
William
and
my
wife
who
never
attempts
to
extort
confidences
gave
her
permission
and
asked
no
questions
On
each
occasion
Jane
came
back
looking
flushed
and
very
determined
At
last
one
day
she
became
communicative
William
is
being
led
away
she
remarked
abruptly
with
a
catching
of
the
breath
apropos
of
tablecloths
Yes
mm
She
is
a
milliner
and
she
can
play
on
the
piano
I
thought
said
my
wife
that
you
went
out
with
him
on
Sunday
Not
out
with
him
mmafter
him
I
walked
along
by
the
side
of
them
and
told
her
he
was
engaged
to
me
Dear
me
Jane
did
you
What
did
they
do
Took
no
more
notice
of
me
than
if
I
was
dirt
So
I
told
her
she
should
suffer
for
it
It
could
not
have
been
a
very
agreeable
walk
Jane
Not
for
no
parties
maam
I
wish
said
Jane
I
could
play
the
piano
maam
But
anyhow
I
dont
mean
to
let
her
get
him
away
from
me
Shes
older
than
him
and
her
hair
aint
gold
to
the
roots
maam
It
was
on
the
August
Bank
Holiday
that
the
crisis
came
We
do
not
clearly
know
the
details
of
the
fray
but
only
such
fragments
as
poor
Jane
let
fall
She
came
home
dusty
excited
and
with
her
heart
hot
within
her
The
milliners
mother
the
milliner
and
William
had
made
a
party
to
the
Art
Museum
at
South
Kensington
I
think
Anyhow
Jane
had
calmly
but
firmly
accosted
them
somewhere
in
the
streets
and
asserted
her
right
to
what
in
spite
of
the
consensus
of
literature
she
held
to
be
her
inalienable
property
She
did
I
think
go
so
far
as
to
lay
hands
on
him
They
dealt
with
her
in
a
crushingly
superior
way
They
called
a
cab
There
was
a
scene
William
being
pulled
away
into
the
fourwheeler
by
his
future
wife
and
motherinlaw
from
the
reluctant
hands
of
our
discarded
Jane
There
were
threats
of
giving
her
in
charge
My
poor
Jane!
said
my
wife
mincing
veal
as
though
she
was
mincing
William
Its
a
shame
of
them
I
would
think
no
more
of
him
He
is
not
worthy
of
you
No
mm
said
Jane
He
is
weak
But
its
that
woman
has
done
it
said
Jane
She
was
never
known
to
bring
herself
to
pronounce
that
womans
name
or
to
admit
her
girlishness
I
cant
think
what
minds
some
women
must
haveto
try
and
get
a
girls
young
man
away
from
her
But
there
it
only
hurts
to
talk
about
it
said
Jane
Thereafter
our
house
rested
from
William
But
there
was
something
in
the
manner
of
Janes
scrubbing
the
front
doorstep
or
sweeping
out
the
rooms
a
certain
viciousness
that
persuaded
me
that
the
story
had
not
yet
ended
Please
mm
may
I
go
and
see
a
wedding
tomorrow
said
Jane
one
day
My
wife
knew
by
instinct
whose
wedding
Do
you
think
it
is
wise
Jane
she
said
I
would
like
to
see
the
last
of
him
said
Jane
My
dear
said
my
wife
fluttering
into
my
room
about
twenty
minutes
after
Jane
had
started
Jane
has
been
to
the
boothole
and
taken
all
the
leftoff
boots
and
shoes
and
gone
off
to
the
wedding
with
them
in
a
bag
Surely
she
cannot
mean
Jane
I
said
is
developing
character
Let
us
hope
for
the
best
Jane
came
back
with
a
pale
hard
face
All
the
boots
seemed
to
be
still
in
her
bag
at
which
my
wife
heaved
a
premature
sigh
of
relief
We
heard
her
go
upstairs
and
replace
the
boots
with
considerable
emphasis
Quite
a
crowd
at
the
wedding
maam
she
said
presently
in
a
purely
conversational
style
sitting
in
our
little
kitchen
and
scrubbing
the
potatoes
and
such
a
lovely
day
for
them
She
proceeded
to
numerous
other
details
clearly
avoiding
some
cardinal
incident
It
was
all
extremely
respectable
and
nice
maam
but
her
father
didnt
wear
a
black
coat
and
looked
quite
out
of
place
maam
Mr
Piddingquirk
Who
Mr
PiddingquirkWilliam
that
was
maamhad
white
gloves
and
a
coat
like
a
clergyman
and
a
lovely
chrysanthemum
He
looked
so
nice
maam
And
there
was
red
carpet
down
just
like
for
gentlefolks
And
they
say
he
gave
the
clerk
four
shillings
maam
It
was
a
real
kerridge
they
hadnot
a
fly
When
they
came
out
of
church
there
was
ricethrowing
and
her
two
little
sisters
dropping
dead
flowers
And
someone
threw
a
slipper
and
then
I
threw
a
boot
Threw
a
boot
Jane!
Yes
maam
Aimed
at
her
But
it
hit
him
Yes
maam
hard
Gev
him
a
black
eye
I
should
think
I
only
threw
that
one
I
hadnt
the
heart
to
try
again
All
the
little
boys
cheered
when
it
hit
him
After
an
intervalI
am
sorry
the
boot
hit
him
Another
pause
The
potatoes
were
being
scrubbed
violently
He
always
was
a
bit
above
me
you
know
maam
And
he
was
led
away
The
potatoes
were
more
than
finished
Jane
rose
sharply
with
a
sigh
and
rapped
the
basin
down
on
the
table
I
dont
care
she
said
I
dont
care
a
rap
He
will
find
out
his
mistake
yet
It
serves
me
right
I
was
stuck
up
about
him
I
ought
not
to
have
looked
so
high
And
I
am
glad
things
are
as
things
are
My
wife
was
in
the
kitchen
seeing
to
the
higher
cookery
After
the
confession
of
the
bootthrowing
she
must
have
watched
poor
Jane
fuming
with
a
certain
dismay
in
those
brown
eyes
of
hers
But
I
imagine
they
softened
again
very
quickly
and
then
Janes
must
have
met
them
Oh
maam
said
Jane
with
an
astonishing
change
of
note
think
of
all
that
might
have
been!
Oh
maam
I
could
have
been
so
happy!
I
ought
to
have
known
but
I
didnt
know
Youre
very
kind
to
let
me
talk
to
you
maam

for
its
hard
on
me
maam

its
harrrrd
And
I
gather
that
Euphemia
so
far
forgot
herself
as
to
let
Jane
sob
out
some
of
the
fulness
of
her
heart
on
a
sympathetic
shoulder
My
Euphemia
thank
Heaven
has
never
properly
grasped
the
importance
of
keeping
up
her
position
And
since
that
fit
of
weeping
much
of
the
accent
of
bitterness
has
gone
out
of
Janes
scrubbing
and
brush
work
Indeed
something
passed
the
other
day
with
the
butcherboybut
that
scarcely
belongs
to
this
story
However
Jane
is
young
still
and
time
and
change
are
at
work
with
her
We
all
have
our
sorrows
but
I
do
not
believe
very
much
in
the
existence
of
sorrows
that
never
heal
IN
THE
MODERN
VEIN
AN
UNSYMPATHETIC
LOVE
STORY
Of
course
the
cultivated
reader
has
heard
of
Aubrey
Vair
He
has
published
on
three
several
occasions
volumes
of
delicate
versessome
indeed
border
on
indelicacyand
his
column
Of
Things
Literary
in
the
Climax
is
well
known
His
Byronic
visage
and
an
interview
have
appeared
in
the
Perfect
Lady
It
was
Aubrey
Vair
I
believe
who
demonstrated
that
the
humour
of
Dickens
was
worse
than
his
sentiment
and
who
detected
a
subtle
bourgeois
flavour
in
Shakespeare
However
it
is
not
generally
known
that
Aubrey
Vair
has
had
erotic
experiences
as
well
as
erotic
inspirations
He
adopted
Goethe
some
little
time
since
as
his
literary
prototype
and
that
may
have
had
something
to
do
with
his
temporary
lapse
from
sexual
integrity
For
it
is
one
of
the
commonest
things
that
undermine
literary
men
giving
us
landslips
and
picturesque
effects
along
the
otherwise
even
cliff
of
their
respectable
life
ranking
next
to
avarice
and
certainly
above
drink
this
instability
called
genius
or
more
fully
the
consciousness
of
genius
such
as
Aubrey
Vair
possessed
Since
Shelley
set
the
fashion
your
man
of
gifts
has
been
assured
that
his
duty
to
himself
and
his
duty
to
his
wife
are
incompatible
and
his
renunciation
of
the
Philistine
has
been
marked
by
such
infidelity
as
his
means
and
courage
warranted
Most
virtue
is
lack
of
imagination
At
anyrate
a
minor
genius
without
his
affections
twisted
into
an
inextricable
muddle
and
who
did
not
occasionally
shed
sonnets
over
his
troubles
I
have
never
met
Even
Aubrey
Vair
did
this
weeping
the
sonnets
overnight
into
his
blottingbook
and
pretending
to
write
literary
causerie
when
his
wife
came
down
in
her
bath
slippers
to
see
what
kept
him
up
She
did
not
understand
him
of
course
He
did
this
even
before
the
other
woman
appeared
so
ingrained
is
conjugal
treachery
in
the
talented
mind
Indeed
he
wrote
more
sonnets
before
the
other
woman
came
than
after
that
event
because
thereafter
he
spent
much
of
his
leisure
in
cutting
down
the
old
productions
retrimming
them
and
generally
altering
this
readymade
clothing
of
his
passion
to
suit
her
particular
height
and
complexion
Aubrey
Vair
lived
in
a
little
red
villa
with
a
lawn
at
the
back
and
a
view
of
the
Downs
behind
Reigate
He
lived
upon
discreet
investment
eked
out
by
literary
work
His
wife
was
handsome
sweet
and
gentle
andsuch
is
the
tender
humility
of
good
married
womenshe
found
her
lifes
happiness
in
seeing
that
little
Aubrey
Vair
had
wellcooked
variety
for
dinner
and
that
their
house
was
the
neatest
and
brightest
of
all
the
houses
they
entered
Aubrey
Vair
enjoyed
the
dinners
and
was
proud
of
the
house
yet
nevertheless
he
mourned
because
his
genius
dwindled
Moreover
he
grew
plump
and
corpulence
threatened
him
We
learn
in
suffering
what
we
teach
in
song
and
Aubrey
Vair
knew
certainly
that
his
soul
could
give
no
creditable
crops
unless
his
affections
were
harrowed
And
how
to
harrow
them
was
the
trouble
for
Reigate
is
a
moral
neighbourhood
So
Aubrey
Vairs
romantic
longings
blew
loose
for
a
time
much
as
a
seedling
creeper
might
planted
in
the
midst
of
a
flowerbed
But
at
last
in
the
fulness
of
time
the
other
woman
came
to
the
embrace
of
Aubrey
Vairs
yearning
hearttendrils
and
his
romantic
episode
proceeded
as
is
here
faithfully
written
down
The
other
woman
was
really
a
girl
and
Aubrey
Vair
met
her
first
at
a
tennis
party
at
Redhill
Aubrey
Vair
did
not
play
tennis
after
the
accident
to
Miss
Mortons
eye
and
because
latterly
it
made
him
pant
and
get
warmer
and
moister
than
even
a
poet
should
be
and
this
young
lady
had
only
recently
arrived
in
England
and
could
not
play
So
they
gravitated
into
the
two
vacant
basket
chairs
beside
Mrs
Baynes
deaf
aunt
in
front
of
the
hollyhocks
and
were
presently
talking
at
their
ease
together
The
other
womans
name
was
unpropitiousMiss
Smithbut
you
would
never
have
suspected
it
from
her
face
and
costume
Her
parentage
was
promising
she
was
an
orphan
her
mother
was
a
Hindoo
and
her
father
an
Indian
civil
servant
and
Aubrey
Vairhimself
a
happy
mixture
of
Kelt
and
Teuton
as
indeed
all
literary
men
have
to
be
nowadaysnaturally
believed
in
the
literary
consequences
of
a
mixture
of
races
She
was
dressed
in
white
She
had
finely
moulded
pale
features
great
depth
of
expression
and
a
cloud
of
delicately
fris
black
hair
over
her
dark
eyes
and
she
looked
at
Aubrey
Vair
with
a
look
half
curious
and
half
shy
that
contrasted
admirably
with
the
stereotyped
frankness
of
your
common
Reigate
girl
This
is
a
splendid
lawnthe
best
in
Redhill
said
Aubrey
Vair
in
the
course
of
the
conversation
and
I
like
it
all
the
better
because
the
daisies
are
spared
He
indicated
the
daisies
with
a
graceful
sweep
of
his
rather
elegant
hand
They
are
sweet
little
flowers
said
the
lady
in
white
and
I
have
always
associated
them
with
England
chiefly
perhaps
through
a
picture
I
saw
over
there
when
I
was
very
little
of
children
making
daisy
chains
I
promised
myself
that
pleasure
when
I
came
home
But
alas!
I
feel
now
rather
too
large
for
such
delights
I
do
not
see
why
we
should
not
be
able
to
enjoy
these
simple
pleasures
as
we
grow
olderwhy
our
growth
should
have
in
it
so
much
forgetting
For
my
own
part
Has
your
wife
got
Janes
recipe
for
stuffing
trout
asked
Mrs
Baynes
deaf
aunt
abruptly
I
really
dont
know
said
Aubrey
Vair
Thats
all
right
said
Mrs
Baynes
deaf
aunt
It
ought
to
please
even
you
Anything
will
please
me
said
Aubrey
Vair
I
care
very
little
Oh
its
a
lovely
dish
said
Mrs
Baynes
deaf
aunt
and
relapsed
into
contemplation
I
was
saying
said
Aubrey
Vair
that
I
think
I
still
find
my
keenest
pleasures
in
childish
pastimes
I
have
a
little
nephew
that
I
see
a
great
deal
of
and
when
we
fly
kites
together
I
am
sure
it
would
be
hard
to
tell
which
of
us
is
the
happier
By
the
bye
you
should
get
at
your
daisy
chains
in
that
way
Beguile
some
little
girl
But
I
did
I
took
that
Morton
mite
for
a
walk
in
the
meadows
and
timidly
broached
the
subject
And
she
reproached
me
for
suggesting
frivolous
pursuits
It
was
a
horrible
disappointment
The
governess
here
said
Aubrey
Vair
is
robbing
that
child
of
its
youth
in
a
terrible
way
What
will
a
life
be
that
has
no
childhood
at
the
beginning
Some
human
beings
are
never
young
he
continued
and
they
never
grow
up
They
lead
absolutely
colourless
lives
They
arethey
are
etiolated
They
never
love
and
never
feel
the
loss
of
it
They
arefor
the
moment
I
can
think
of
no
better
imagethey
are
human
flowerpots
in
which
no
soul
has
been
planted
But
a
human
soul
properly
growing
must
begin
in
a
fresh
childishness
Yes
said
the
dark
lady
thoughtfully
a
careless
childhood
running
wild
almost
That
should
be
the
beginning
Then
we
pass
through
the
wonder
and
diffidence
of
youth
To
strength
and
action
said
the
dark
lady
Her
dreamy
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
Downs
and
her
fingers
tightened
on
her
knees
as
she
spoke
Ah
it
is
a
grand
thing
to
liveas
a
man
doesselfreliant
and
free
And
so
at
last
said
Aubrey
Vair
come
to
the
culmination
and
crown
of
life
He
paused
and
glanced
hastily
at
her
Then
he
dropped
his
voice
almost
to
a
whisperAnd
the
culmination
of
life
is
love
Their
eyes
met
for
a
moment
but
she
looked
away
at
once
Aubrey
Vair
felt
a
peculiar
thrill
and
a
catching
in
his
breath
but
his
emotions
were
too
complex
for
analysis
He
had
a
certain
sense
of
surprise
also
at
the
way
his
conversation
had
developed
Mrs
Baynes
deaf
aunt
suddenly
dug
him
in
the
chest
with
her
eartrumpet
and
someone
at
tennis
bawled
Love
all!
Did
I
tell
you
Janes
girls
have
had
scarlet
fever
asked
Mrs
Baynes
deaf
aunt
No
said
Aubrey
Vair
Yes
and
they
are
peeling
now
said
Mrs
Baynes
deaf
aunt
shutting
her
lips
tightly
and
nodding
in
a
slow
significant
manner
at
both
of
them
There
was
a
pause
All
three
seemed
lost
in
thought
too
deep
for
words
Love
began
Aubrey
Vair
presently
in
a
severely
philosophical
tone
leaning
back
in
his
chair
holding
his
hands
like
a
praying
saints
in
front
of
him
and
staring
at
the
toe
of
his
shoelove
is
I
believe
the
one
true
and
real
thing
in
life
It
rises
above
reason
interest
or
explanation
Yet
I
never
read
of
an
age
when
it
was
so
much
forgotten
as
it
is
now
Never
was
love
expected
to
run
so
much
in
appointed
channels
never
was
it
so
despised
checked
ordered
and
obstructed
Policemen
say
This
way
Eros!
As
a
result
we
relieve
our
emotional
possibilities
in
the
hunt
for
gold
and
notoriety
And
after
all
with
the
best
fortune
in
these
we
only
hold
up
the
gilded
images
of
our
success
and
are
weary
slaves
with
unsatisfied
hearts
in
the
pageant
of
life
Aubrey
Vair
sighed
and
there
was
a
pause
The
girl
looked
at
him
out
of
the
mysterious
darkness
of
her
eyes
She
had
read
many
books
but
Aubrey
Vair
was
her
first
literary
man
and
she
took
this
kind
of
thing
for
geniusas
girls
have
done
before
We
are
continued
Aubrey
Vair
conscious
of
a
favourable
impressionwe
are
like
fireworks
mere
dead
inert
things
until
the
appointed
spark
comes
and
thenif
it
is
not
dampthe
dormant
soul
blazes
forth
in
all
its
warmth
and
beauty
That
is
living
I
sometimes
think
do
you
know
that
we
should
be
happier
if
we
could
die
soon
after
that
golden
time
like
the
Ephemerides
There
is
a
decay
sets
in
Eigh
said
Mrs
Baynes
deaf
aunt
startlingly
I
didnt
hear
you
I
was
on
the
point
of
remarking
shouted
Aubrey
Vair
wheeling
the
array
of
his
thoughtsI
was
on
the
point
of
remarking
that
few
people
in
Redhill
could
match
Mrs
Mortons
fine
broad
green
Others
have
noticed
it
Mrs
Baynes
deaf
aunt
shouted
back
It
is
since
she
has
had
in
her
new
false
teeth
This
interruption
dislocated
the
conversation
a
little
However
I
must
thank
you
Mr
Vair
said
the
dark
girl
when
they
parted
that
afternoon
for
having
given
me
very
much
to
think
about
And
from
her
manner
Aubrey
Vair
perceived
clearly
he
had
not
wasted
his
time





It
would
require
a
subtler
pen
than
mine
to
tell
how
from
that
day
a
passion
for
Miss
Smith
grew
like
Jonahs
gourd
in
the
heart
of
Aubrey
Vair
He
became
pensive
and
in
the
prolonged
absence
of
Miss
Smith
irritable
Mrs
Aubrey
Vair
felt
the
change
in
him
and
put
it
down
to
a
vitriolic
Saturday
Reviewer
Indisputably
the
Saturday
does
at
times
go
a
little
far
He
reread
Elective
Affinities
and
lent
it
to
Miss
Smith
Incredible
as
it
may
appear
to
members
of
the
Areopagus
Club
where
we
know
Aubrey
Vair
he
did
also
beyond
all
question
inspire
a
sort
of
passion
in
that
sombreeyed
rather
clever
and
really
very
beautiful
girl
He
talked
to
her
a
lot
about
love
and
destiny
and
all
that
bric
brac
of
the
minor
poet
And
they
talked
together
about
his
genius
He
elaborately
though
discreetly
sought
her
society
and
presented
and
read
to
her
the
milder
of
his
unpublished
sonnets
We
consider
his
Byronic
features
pasty
but
the
feminine
mind
has
its
own
laws
I
suppose
also
where
a
girl
is
not
a
fool
a
literary
man
has
an
enormous
advantage
over
anyone
but
a
preacher
in
the
show
he
can
make
of
his
hearts
wares
At
last
a
day
in
that
summer
came
when
he
met
her
alone
possibly
by
chance
in
a
quiet
lane
towards
Horley
There
were
ample
hedges
on
either
side
rich
with
honeysuckle
vetch
and
mullein
They
conversed
intimately
of
his
poetic
ambitions
and
then
he
read
her
those
verses
of
his
subsequently
published
in
Hobsons
Magazine
Tenderly
ever
since
I
have
met
thee
He
had
written
these
the
day
before
and
though
I
think
the
sentiment
is
uncommonly
trite
there
is
a
redeeming
note
of
sincerity
about
the
lines
not
conspicuous
in
all
Aubrey
Vairs
poetry
He
read
rather
well
and
a
swell
of
genuine
emotion
crept
into
his
voice
as
he
read
with
one
white
hand
thrown
out
to
point
the
rhythm
of
the
lines
Ever
my
sweet
for
thee
he
concluded
looking
up
into
her
face
Before
he
looked
up
he
had
been
thinking
chiefly
of
his
poem
and
its
effect
Straightway
he
forgot
it
Her
arms
hung
limply
before
her
and
her
hands
were
clasped
together
Her
eyes
were
very
tender
Your
verses
go
to
the
heart
she
said
softly
Her
mobile
features
were
capable
of
wonderful
shades
of
expression
He
suddenly
forgot
his
wife
and
his
position
as
a
minor
poet
as
he
looked
at
her
It
is
possible
that
his
classical
features
may
themselves
have
undergone
a
certain
transfiguration
For
one
brief
momentand
it
was
always
to
linger
in
his
memorydestiny
lifted
him
out
of
his
vain
little
self
to
a
nobler
level
of
simplicity
The
copy
of
Tenderly
ever
fluttered
from
his
hand
Considerations
vanished
Only
one
thing
seemed
of
importance
I
love
you
he
said
abruptly
An
expression
of
fear
came
into
her
eyes
The
grip
of
her
hands
upon
one
another
tightened
convulsively
She
became
very
pale
Then
she
moved
her
lips
as
if
to
speak
bringing
her
face
slightly
nearer
to
his
There
was
nothing
in
the
world
at
that
moment
for
either
of
them
but
one
another
They
were
both
trembling
exceedingly
In
a
whisper
she
said
You
love
me
Aubrey
Vair
stood
quivering
and
speechless
looking
into
her
eyes
He
had
never
seen
such
a
light
as
he
saw
there
before
He
was
in
a
wild
tumult
of
emotion
He
was
dreadfully
scared
at
what
he
had
done
He
could
not
say
another
word
He
nodded
And
this
has
come
to
me
she
said
presently
in
the
same
awestricken
whisper
and
then
Oh
my
love
my
love!
And
thereupon
Aubrey
Vair
had
her
clasped
to
himself
her
cheek
upon
his
shoulder
and
his
lips
to
hers
Thus
it
was
that
Aubrey
Vair
came
by
the
cardinal
memory
of
his
life
To
this
day
it
recurs
in
his
works
A
little
boy
clambering
in
the
hedge
some
way
down
the
lane
saw
this
group
with
surprise
and
then
with
scorn
and
contempt
Recking
nothing
of
his
destiny
he
turned
away
feeling
that
he
at
least
could
never
come
to
the
unspeakable
unmanliness
of
hugging
girls
Unhappily
for
Reigate
scandal
his
shame
for
his
sex
was
altogether
too
deep
for
words





An
hour
after
Aubrey
Vair
returned
home
in
a
hushed
mood
There
were
muffins
after
his
own
heart
for
his
teaMrs
Aubrey
Vair
had
had
hers
And
there
were
chrysanthemums
chiefly
white
onesflowers
he
lovedset
out
in
the
china
bowl
he
was
wont
to
praise
And
his
wife
came
behind
him
to
kiss
him
as
he
sat
eating
De
lill
Jummuns
she
remarked
kissing
him
under
the
ear
Then
it
came
into
the
mind
of
Aubrey
Vair
with
startling
clearness
while
his
ear
was
being
kissed
and
with
his
mouth
full
of
muffin
that
life
is
a
singularly
complex
thing





The
summer
passed
at
last
into
the
harvesttime
and
the
leaves
began
falling
It
was
evening
the
warm
sunset
light
still
touched
the
Downs
but
up
the
valley
a
blue
haze
was
creeping
One
or
two
lamps
in
Reigate
were
already
alight
About
halfway
up
the
slanting
road
that
scales
the
Downs
there
is
a
wooden
seat
where
one
may
obtain
a
fine
view
of
the
red
villas
scattered
below
and
of
the
succession
of
blue
hills
beyond
Here
the
girl
with
the
shadowy
face
was
sitting
She
had
a
book
on
her
knees
but
it
lay
neglected
She
was
leaning
forward
her
chin
resting
upon
her
hand
She
was
looking
across
the
valley
into
the
darkening
sky
with
troubled
eyes
Aubrey
Vair
appeared
through
the
hazelbushes
and
sat
down
beside
her
He
held
half
a
dozen
dead
leaves
in
his
hand
She
did
not
alter
her
attitude
Well
she
said
Is
it
to
be
flight
he
asked
Aubrey
Vair
was
rather
pale
He
had
been
having
bad
nights
latterly
with
dreams
of
the
Continental
Express
Mrs
Aubrey
Vair
possibly
even
in
pursuithe
always
fancied
her
making
the
tragedy
ridiculous
by
tearfully
bringing
additional
pairs
of
socks
and
any
such
trifles
he
had
forgotten
with
herall
Reigate
and
Redhill
in
commotion
He
had
never
eloped
before
and
he
had
visions
of
difficulties
with
hotel
proprietors
Mrs
Aubrey
Vair
might
telegraph
ahead
Even
he
had
had
a
prophetic
vision
of
a
headline
in
a
halfpenny
evening
newspaper
Young
Lady
abducts
a
Minor
Poet
So
there
was
a
quaver
in
his
voice
as
he
asked
Is
it
to
be
flight
As
you
will
she
answered
still
not
looking
at
him
I
want
you
to
consider
particularly
how
this
will
affect
you
A
man
said
Aubrey
Vair
slowly
and
staring
hard
at
the
leaves
in
his
hand
even
gains
a
certain
clat
in
these
affairs
But
to
a
woman
it
is
ruinsocial
moral
This
is
not
love
said
the
girl
in
white
Ah
my
dearest!
Think
of
yourself
Stupid!
she
said
under
her
breath
You
spoke
Nothing
But
cannot
we
go
on
meeting
one
another
loving
one
another
without
any
great
scandal
or
misery
Could
we
not
That
interrupted
Miss
Smith
would
be
unspeakably
horrible
This
is
a
dreadful
conversation
to
me
Life
is
so
intricate
such
a
web
of
subtle
strands
binds
us
this
way
and
that
I
cannot
tell
what
is
right
You
must
consider
A
man
would
break
such
strands
There
is
no
manliness
said
Aubrey
Vair
with
a
sudden
glow
of
moral
exaltation
in
doing
wrong
My
love
We
could
at
least
die
together
dearest
she
said
Good
Lord!
said
Aubrey
Vair
I
meanconsider
my
wife
You
have
not
considered
her
hitherto
There
is
a
flavourof
cowardice
of
desertion
about
suicide
said
Aubrey
Vair
Frankly
I
have
the
English
prejudice
and
do
not
like
any
kind
of
running
away
Miss
Smith
smiled
very
faintly
I
see
clearly
now
what
I
did
not
see
My
love
and
yours
are
very
different
things
Possibly
it
is
a
sexual
difference
said
Aubrey
Vair
and
then
feeling
the
remark
inadequate
he
relapsed
into
silence
They
sat
for
some
time
without
a
word
The
two
lights
in
Reigate
below
multiplied
to
a
score
of
bright
points
and
above
one
star
had
become
visible
She
began
laughing
an
almost
noiseless
hysterical
laugh
that
jarred
unaccountably
upon
Aubrey
Vair
Presently
she
stood
up
They
will
wonder
where
I
am
she
said
I
think
I
must
be
going
He
followed
her
to
the
road
Then
this
is
the
end
he
said
with
a
curious
mixture
of
relief
and
poignant
regret
Yes
this
is
the
end
she
answered
and
turned
away
There
straightway
dropped
into
the
soul
of
Aubrey
Vair
a
sense
of
infinite
loss
It
was
an
altogether
new
sensation
She
was
perhaps
twenty
yards
away
when
he
groaned
aloud
with
the
weight
of
it
and
suddenly
began
running
after
her
with
his
arms
extended
Annie
he
criedAnnie!
I
have
been
talking
rot
Annie
now
I
know
I
love
you!
I
cannot
spare
you
This
must
not
be
I
did
not
understand
The
weight
was
horrible
Oh
stop
Annie!
he
cried
with
a
breaking
voice
and
there
were
tears
on
his
face
She
turned
upon
him
suddenly
and
his
arms
fell
by
his
side
His
expression
changed
at
the
sight
of
her
pale
face
You
do
not
understand
she
said
I
have
said
goodbye
She
looked
at
him
he
was
evidently
greatly
distressed
a
little
out
of
breath
and
he
had
just
stopped
blubbering
His
contemptible
quality
reached
the
pathetic
She
came
up
close
to
him
and
taking
his
damp
Byronic
visage
between
her
hands
she
kissed
him
again
and
again
Goodbye
little
man
that
I
loved
she
said
and
goodbye
to
this
folly
of
love
Then
with
something
that
may
have
been
a
laugh
or
a
sobshe
herself
when
she
came
to
write
it
all
in
her
novel
did
not
know
whichshe
turned
and
hurried
away
again
and
went
out
of
the
path
that
Aubrey
Vair
must
pursue
at
the
crossroads
Aubrey
Vair
stood
where
she
had
kissed
him
with
a
mind
as
inactive
as
his
body
until
her
white
dress
had
disappeared
Then
he
gave
an
involuntary
sigh
a
large
exhaustive
expiration
and
so
awoke
himself
and
began
walking
pensively
dragging
his
feet
through
the
dead
leaves
home
Emotions
are
terrible
things





Do
you
like
the
potatoes
dear
asked
Mrs
Aubrey
Vair
at
dinner
I
cooked
them
myself
Aubrey
Vair
descended
slowly
from
cloudy
impalpable
meditations
to
the
level
of
fried
potatoes
These
potatoeshe
remarked
after
a
pause
during
which
he
was
struggling
with
recollection
Yes
These
potatoes
have
exactly
the
tints
of
the
dead
leaves
of
the
hazel
What
a
fanciful
poet
it
is!
said
Mrs
Aubrey
Vair
Taste
them
They
are
very
nice
potatoes
indeed
A
CATASTROPHE
The
little
shop
was
not
paying
The
realisation
came
insensibly
Winslow
was
not
the
man
for
definite
addition
and
subtraction
and
sudden
discovery
He
became
aware
of
the
truth
in
his
mind
gradually
as
though
it
had
always
been
there
A
lot
of
facts
had
converged
and
led
him
there
There
was
that
line
of
cretonnesfour
halfpiecesuntouched
save
for
half
a
yard
sold
to
cover
a
stool
There
were
those
shirtings
at

dBandersnatch
in
the
Broadway
was
selling
them
at

dunder
cost
in
fact
Surely
Bandersnatch
might
let
a
man
live!
Those
servants
caps
a
selling
line
needed
replenishing
and
that
brought
back
the
memory
of
Winslows
sole
wholesale
dealers
Helter
Skelter

Grab
Why!
how
about
their
account
Winslow
stood
with
a
big
green
box
open
on
the
counter
before
him
when
he
thought
of
it
His
pale
grey
eyes
grew
a
little
rounder
his
pale
straggling
moustache
twitched
He
had
been
drifting
along
day
after
day
He
went
round
to
the
ramshackle
cashdesk
in
the
cornerit
was
Winslows
weakness
to
sell
his
goods
over
the
counter
give
his
customers
a
duplicate
bill
and
then
dodge
into
the
desk
to
receive
the
money
as
though
he
doubted
his
own
honesty
His
lank
forefinger
with
the
prominent
joints
ran
down
the
bright
little
calendar
Clacks
Cottons
last
for
All
Time
Onetwothree

said
Winslow
staring
March!
Only
three
weeks
and
a
day
It
cant
be
Tea
dear
said
Mrs
Winslow
opening
the
door
with
the
glass
window
and
the
white
blind
that
communicated
with
the
parlour
One
minute
said
Winslow
and
began
unlocking
the
desk
An
irritable
old
gentleman
very
hot
and
red
about
the
face
and
in
a
heavy
furlined
cloak
came
in
noisily
Mrs
Winslow
vanished
Ugh!
said
the
old
gentleman
Pockethandkerchief
Yes
sir
said
Winslow
About
what
price
Ugh!
said
the
old
gentleman
Poggithandkerchief
quig!
Winslow
began
to
feel
flustered
He
produced
two
boxes
These
sirbegan
Winslow
Sheed
tin!
said
the
old
gentleman
clutching
the
stiffness
of
the
linen
Wad

blow

nosenot
haggit
about
A

praps
sir
said
Winslow
How
much
said
the
old
gentleman
over
the
handkerchief
Sevenpence
sir
Theres
nothing
more
I
can
show
you
No
ties
braces
Damn!
said
the
old
gentleman
fumbling
in
his
ticketpocket
and
finally
producing
half
a
crown
Winslow
looked
round
for
his
little
metallic
duplicatebook
which
he
kept
in
various
fixtures
according
to
circumstances
and
then
he
caught
the
old
gentlemans
eye
He
went
straight
to
the
desk
at
once
and
got
the
change
with
an
entire
disregard
of
the
routine
of
the
shop
Winslow
was
always
more
or
less
excited
by
a
customer
But
the
open
desk
reminded
him
of
his
trouble
It
did
not
come
back
to
him
all
at
once
He
heard
a
fingernail
softly
tapping
on
the
glass
and
looking
up
saw
Minnies
eyes
over
the
blind
It
seemed
like
retreat
opening
He
shut
and
locked
the
desk
and
went
into
the
little
room
to
tea
But
he
was
preoccupied
Three
weeks
and
a
day!
He
took
unusually
large
bites
of
his
bread
and
butter
and
stared
hard
at
the
little
pot
of
jam
He
answered
Minnies
conversational
advances
distractedly
The
shadow
of
Helter
Skelter

Grab
lay
upon
the
teatable
He
was
struggling
with
this
new
idea
of
failure
the
tangible
realisation
that
was
taking
shape
and
substance
condensing
as
it
were
out
of
the
misty
uneasiness
of
many
days
At
present
it
was
simply
one
concrete
fact
there
were
thirtynine
pounds
left
in
the
bank
and
that
day
three
weeks
Messrs
Helter
Skelter

Grab
those
enterprising
outfitters
of
young
men
would
demand
their
eighty
pounds
After
tea
there
was
a
customer
or
solittle
purchases
some
muslin
and
buckram
dressprotectors
tape
and
a
pair
of
Lisle
hose
Then
knowing
that
Black
Care
was
lurking
in
the
dusky
corners
of
the
shop
he
lit
the
three
lamps
early
and
set
to
refolding
his
cotton
prints
the
most
vigorous
and
least
meditative
proceeding
of
which
he
could
think
He
could
see
Minnies
shadow
in
the
other
room
as
she
moved
about
the
table
She
was
busy
turning
an
old
dress
He
had
a
walk
after
supper
looked
in
at
the
YMCA
but
found
no
one
to
talk
to
and
finally
went
to
bed
Minnie
was
already
there
And
there
too
waiting
for
him
nudging
him
gently
until
about
midnight
he
was
hopelessly
awake
sat
Black
Care
He
had
had
one
or
two
nights
lately
in
that
company
but
this
was
much
worse
First
came
Messrs
Helter
Skelter

Grab
and
their
demand
for
eighty
poundsan
enormous
sum
when
your
original
capital
was
only
a
hundred
and
seventy
They
camped
as
it
were
before
him
sat
down
and
beleaguered
him
He
clutched
feebly
at
the
circumambient
darkness
for
expedients
Suppose
he
had
a
sale
sold
things
for
almost
anything
He
tried
to
imagine
a
sale
miraculously
successful
in
some
unexpected
manner
and
mildly
profitable
in
spite
of
reductions
below
cost
Then
Bandersnatch
Limited






Broadway
joined
the
siege
a
long
caterpillar
of
frontage
a
battery
of
shop
fronts
wherein
things
were
sold
at
a
farthing
above
cost
How
could
he
fight
such
an
establishment
Besides
what
had
he
to
sell
He
began
to
review
his
resources
What
taking
line
was
there
to
bait
the
sale
Then
straightway
came
those
pieces
of
cretonne
yellow
and
black
with
a
bluishgreen
flower
those
discredited
skirtings
prints
without
buoyancy
skirmishing
haberdashery
some
despairful
fourbutton
gloves
by
an
inferior
makera
hopeless
crew
And
that
was
his
force
against
Bandersnatch
Helter
Skelter

Grab
and
the
pitiless
world
behind
them
Whatever
had
made
him
think
a
mortal
would
buy
such
things
Why
had
he
bought
this
and
neglected
that
He
suddenly
realised
the
intensity
of
his
hatred
for
Helter
Skelter

Grabs
salesman
Then
he
drove
towards
an
agony
of
selfreproach
He
had
spent
too
much
on
that
cashdesk
What
real
need
was
there
of
a
desk
He
saw
his
vanity
of
that
desk
in
a
lurid
glow
of
selfdiscovery
And
the
lamps
Five
pounds!
Then
suddenly
with
what
was
almost
physical
pain
he
remembered
the
rent
He
groaned
and
turned
over
And
there
dim
in
the
darkness
was
the
hummock
of
Mrs
Winslows
shoulders
That
set
him
off
in
another
direction
He
became
acutely
sensible
of
Minnies
want
of
feeling
Here
he
was
worried
to
death
about
business
and
she
sleeping
like
a
little
child
He
regretted
having
married
with
that
infinite
bitterness
that
only
comes
to
the
human
heart
in
the
small
hours
of
the
morning
That
hummock
of
white
seemed
absolutely
without
helpfulness
a
burden
a
responsibility
What
fools
men
were
to
marry!
Minnies
inert
repose
irritated
him
so
much
that
he
was
almost
provoked
to
wake
her
up
and
tell
her
that
they
were
Ruined
She
would
have
to
go
back
to
her
uncle
her
uncle
had
always
been
against
him
and
as
for
his
own
future
Winslow
was
exceedingly
uncertain
A
shop
assistant
who
has
once
set
up
for
himself
finds
the
utmost
difficulty
in
getting
into
a
situation
again
He
began
to
figure
himself
cribhunting
again
going
from
this
wholesale
house
to
that
writing
innumerable
letters
How
he
hated
writing
letters!
SirReferring
to
your
advertisement
in
the
Christian
World
He
beheld
an
infinite
vista
of
discomfort
and
disappointment
endingin
a
gulf
He
dressed
yawning
and
went
down
to
open
the
shop
He
felt
tired
before
the
day
began
As
he
carried
the
shutters
in
he
kept
asking
himself
what
good
he
was
doing
The
end
was
inevitable
whether
he
bothered
or
not
The
clear
daylight
smote
into
the
place
and
showed
how
old
and
rough
and
splintered
was
the
floor
how
shabby
the
secondhand
counter
how
hopeless
the
whole
enterprise
He
had
been
dreaming
these
past
six
months
of
a
bright
little
shop
of
a
happy
couple
of
a
modest
but
comely
profit
flowing
in
He
had
suddenly
awakened
from
his
dream
The
braid
that
bound
his
decent
black
coatit
was
a
little
loosecaught
against
the
catch
of
the
shop
door
and
was
torn
loose
This
suddenly
turned
his
wretchedness
to
wrath
He
stood
quivering
for
a
moment
then
with
a
spiteful
clutch
tore
the
braid
looser
and
went
in
to
Minnie
Here
he
said
with
infinite
reproach
look
here!
You
might
look
after
a
chap
a
bit
I
didnt
see
it
was
torn
said
Minnie
You
never
do
said
Winslow
with
gross
injustice
until
things
are
too
late
Minnie
looked
suddenly
at
his
face
Ill
sew
it
now
Sid
if
you
like
Lets
have
breakfast
first
said
Winslow
and
do
things
at
their
proper
time
He
was
preoccupied
at
breakfast
and
Minnie
watched
him
anxiously
His
only
remark
was
to
declare
his
egg
a
bad
one
It
wasnt
it
was
a
little
flavourybeing
one
of
those
at
fifteen
a
shillingbut
quite
nice
He
pushed
it
away
from
him
and
then
having
eaten
a
slice
of
bread
and
butter
admitted
himself
in
the
wrong
by
resuming
the
egg
Sid
said
Minnie
as
he
stood
up
to
go
into
the
shop
again
youre
not
well
Im
well
enough
He
looked
at
her
as
though
he
hated
her
Then
theres
something
else
the
matter
You
arent
angry
with
me
Sid
are
you
about
that
braid
Do
tell
me
whats
the
matter
You
were
just
like
this
at
tea
yesterday
and
at
suppertime
It
wasnt
the
braid
then
And
Im
likely
to
be
She
looked
interrogation
Oh
what
is
the
matter
she
said
It
was
too
good
a
chance
to
miss
and
he
brought
the
evil
news
out
with
dramatic
force
Matter
he
said
I
done
my
best
and
here
we
are
Thats
the
matter!
If
I
cant
pay
Helter
Skelter

Grab
eighty
pounds

day

weekPause
We
shall
be
sold
up!
Sold
up!
Thats
the
matter
Min!
SOLD
UP!
Oh
Sid!
began
Minnie
He
slammed
the
door
For
the
moment
he
felt
relieved
of
at
least
half
his
misery
He
began
dusting
boxes
that
did
not
require
dusting
and
then
reblocked
a
cretonne
already
faultlessly
blocked
He
was
in
a
state
of
grim
wretchedness
a
martyr
under
the
harrow
of
fate
At
anyrate
it
should
not
be
said
he
failed
for
want
of
industry
And
how
he
had
planned
and
contrived
and
worked!
All
to
this
end!
He
felt
horrible
doubts
Providence
and
Bandersnatchsurely
they
were
incompatible!
Perhaps
he
was
being
tried
That
sent
him
off
upon
a
new
tack
a
very
comforting
one
That
martyr
pose
the
goldinthefurnace
attitude
lasted
all
the
morning
At
dinnerpotato
piehe
looked
up
suddenly
and
saw
Minnies
face
regarding
him
Pale
she
looked
and
a
little
red
about
the
eyes
Something
caught
him
suddenly
with
a
queer
effect
upon
his
throat
All
his
thoughts
seemed
to
wheel
round
into
quite
a
new
direction
He
pushed
back
his
plate
and
stared
at
her
blankly
Then
he
got
up
went
round
the
table
to
hershe
staring
at
him
He
dropped
on
his
knees
beside
her
without
a
word
Oh
Minnie!
he
said
and
suddenly
she
knew
it
was
peace
and
put
her
arms
about
him
as
he
began
to
sob
and
weep
He
cried
like
a
little
boy
slobbering
on
her
shoulder
that
he
was
a
knave
to
have
married
her
and
brought
her
to
this
that
he
hadnt
the
wits
to
be
trusted
with
a
penny
that
it
was
all
his
fault
that
he
had
hoped
soending
in
a
howl
And
she
crying
gently
herself
patting
his
shoulders
said
Ssh!
softly
to
his
noisy
weeping
and
so
soothed
the
outbreak
Then
suddenly
the
crazy
little
bell
upon
the
shop
door
began
and
Winslow
had
to
jump
to
his
feet
and
be
a
man
again
After
that
scene
they
talked
it
over
at
tea
at
supper
in
bed
at
every
possible
interval
in
between
solemnlyquite
inconclusivelywith
set
faces
and
eyes
for
the
most
part
staring
in
front
of
themand
yet
with
a
certain
mutual
comfort
What
to
do
I
dont
know
was
Winslows
main
proposition
Minnie
tried
to
take
a
cheerful
view
of
servicewith
a
probable
baby
But
she
found
she
needed
all
her
courage
And
her
uncle
would
help
her
again
perhaps
just
at
the
critical
time
It
didnt
do
for
folks
to
be
too
proud
Besides
something
might
happen
a
favourite
formula
with
her
One
hopeful
line
was
to
anticipate
a
sudden
afflux
of
customers
Perhaps
said
Minnie
you
might
get
together
fifty
They
know
you
well
enough
to
trust
you
a
bit
They
debated
that
point
Once
the
possibility
of
Helter
Skelter
and
Grab
giving
credit
was
admitted
it
was
pleasant
to
begin
sweating
the
acceptable
minimum
For
some
halfhour
over
tea
the
second
day
after
Winslows
discoveries
they
were
quite
cheerful
again
laughing
even
at
their
terrific
fears
Even
twenty
pounds
to
go
on
with
might
be
considered
enough
Then
in
some
mysterious
way
the
pleasant
prospect
of
Messrs
Helter
Skelter

Grab
tempering
the
wind
to
the
shorn
retailer
vanishedvanished
absolutely
and
Winslow
found
himself
again
in
the
pit
of
despair
He
began
looking
about
at
the
furniture
and
wondering
idly
what
it
would
fetch
The
chiffonier
was
good
anyhow
and
there
were
Minnies
old
plates
that
her
mother
used
to
have
Then
he
began
to
think
of
desperate
expedients
for
putting
off
the
evil
day
He
had
heard
somewhere
of
Bills
of
Salethere
was
to
his
ears
something
comfortingly
substantial
in
the
phrase
Then
why
not
Go
to
the
MoneyLenders
One
cheering
thing
happened
on
Thursday
afternoon
a
little
girl
came
in
with
a
pattern
of
print
and
he
was
able
to
match
it
He
had
not
been
able
to
match
anything
out
of
his
meagre
stock
before
He
went
in
and
told
Minnie
The
incident
is
mentioned
lest
the
reader
should
imagine
it
was
uniform
despair
with
him
The
next
morning
and
the
next
after
the
discovery
Winslow
opened
shop
late
When
one
has
been
awake
most
of
the
night
and
has
no
hope
what
is
the
good
of
getting
up
punctually
But
as
he
went
into
the
dark
shop
on
Friday
he
saw
something
lying
on
the
floor
something
lit
by
the
bright
light
that
came
under
the
illfitting
doora
black
oblong
He
stooped
and
picked
up
an
envelope
with
a
deep
mourning
edge
It
was
addressed
to
his
wife
Clearly
a
death
in
her
familyperhaps
her
uncle
He
knew
the
man
too
well
to
have
expectations
And
they
would
have
to
get
mourning
and
go
to
the
funeral
The
brutal
cruelty
of
people
dying!
He
saw
it
all
in
a
flashhe
always
visualised
his
thoughts
Black
trousers
to
get
black
crape
black
glovesnone
in

railway
fares
the
shop
closed
for
the
day
Im
afraid
theres
bad
news
Minnie
he
said
She
was
kneeling
before
the
fireplace
blowing
the
fire
She
had
her
housemaids
gloves
on
and
the
old
country
sunbonnet
she
wore
of
a
morning
to
keep
the
dust
out
of
her
hair
She
turned
saw
the
envelope
gave
a
gasp
and
pressed
two
bloodless
lips
together
Im
afraid
its
uncle
she
said
holding
the
letter
and
staring
with
eyes
wide
open
into
Winslows
face
Its
a
strange
hand!
The
postmarks
Hull
said
Winslow
The
postmarks
Hull
Minnie
opened
the
letter
slowly
drew
it
out
hesitated
turned
it
over
saw
the
signature
Its
Mr
Speight!
What
does
he
say
said
Winslow
Minnie
began
to
read
Oh!
she
screamed
She
dropped
the
letter
collapsed
into
a
crouching
heap
her
hands
covering
her
eyes
Winslow
snatched
at
it
A
most
terrible
accident
has
occurred
he
read
Melchiors
chimney
fell
down
yesterday
evening
right
on
the
top
of
your
uncles
house
and
every
living
soul
was
killedyour
uncle
your
cousin
Mary
Will
and
Ned
and
the
girlevery
one
of
them
and

would
hardly
know
them
Im
writing
to
you
to
break
the
news
before
you
see
it
in
the
papersThe
letter
fluttered
from
Winslows
fingers
He
put
out
his
hand
against
the
mantel
to
steady
himself
All
of
them
dead!
Then
he
saw
as
in
a
vision
a
row
of
seven
cottages
each
let
at
seven
shillings
a
week
a
timber
yard
two
villas
and
the
ruinsstill
marketableof
the
avuncular
residence
He
tried
to
feel
a
sense
of
loss
and
could
not
They
were
sure
to
have
been
left
to
Minnies
aunt
All
dead!


began
insensibly
to
work
itself
out
in
his
mind
but
discipline
was
ever
weak
in
his
mental
arithmetic
figures
kept
moving
from
one
line
to
another
like
children
playing
at
Widdy
Widdy
Way
Was
it
two
hundred
pounds
aboutor
one
hundred
pounds
Presently
he
picked
up
the
letter
again
and
finishing
reading
it
You
being
the
next
of
kin
said
Mr
Speight
How
awful!
said
Minnie
in
a
horrorstruck
whisper
and
looking
up
at
last
Winslow
stared
back
at
her
shaking
his
head
solemnly
There
were
a
thousand
things
running
through
his
mind
but
none
that
even
to
his
dull
sense
seemed
appropriate
as
a
remark
It
was
the
Lords
will
he
said
at
last
It
seems
so
very
very
terrible
said
Minnie
auntie
dear
auntieTedpoor
dear
uncle
It
was
the
Lords
will
Minnie
said
Winslow
with
infinite
feeling
A
long
silence
Yes
said
Minnie
very
slowly
staring
thoughtfully
at
the
crackling
black
paper
in
the
grate
The
fire
had
gone
out
Yes
perhaps
it
was
the
Lords
will
They
looked
gravely
at
one
another
Each
would
have
been
terribly
shocked
at
any
mention
of
the
property
by
the
other
She
turned
to
the
dark
fireplace
and
began
tearing
up
an
old
newspaper
slowly
Whatever
our
losses
may
be
the
worlds
work
still
waits
for
us
Winslow
gave
a
deep
sigh
and
walked
in
a
hushed
manner
towards
the
front
door
As
he
opened
it
a
flood
of
sunlight
came
streaming
into
the
dark
shadows
of
the
closed
shop
Bandersnatch
Helter
Skelter

Grab
had
vanished
out
of
his
mind
like
the
mists
before
the
rising
sun
Presently
he
was
carrying
in
the
shutters
and
in
the
briskest
way
the
fire
in
the
kitchen
was
crackling
exhilaratingly
with
a
little
saucepan
walloping
above
it
for
Minnie
was
boiling
two
eggsone
for
herself
this
morning
as
well
as
one
for
himand
Minnie
herself
was
audible
laying
breakfast
with
the
greatest

clat
The
blow
was
a
sudden
and
terrible
onebut
it
behoves
us
to
face
such
things
bravely
in
this
sad
unaccountable
world
It
was
quite
midday
before
either
of
them
mentioned
the
cottages
THE
LOST
INHERITANCE
My
uncle
said
the
man
with
the
glass
eye
was
what
you
might
call
a
hemisemidemi
millionaire
He
was
worth
about
a
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
Quite
And
he
left
me
all
his
money
I
glanced
at
the
shiny
sleeve
of
his
coat
and
my
eye
travelled
up
to
the
frayed
collar
Every
penny
said
the
man
with
the
glass
eye
and
I
caught
the
active
pupil
looking
at
me
with
a
touch
of
offence
Ive
never
had
any
windfalls
like
that
I
said
trying
to
speak
enviously
and
propitiate
him
Even
a
legacy
isnt
always
a
blessing
he
remarked
with
a
sigh
and
with
an
air
of
philosophical
resignation
he
put
the
red
nose
and
the
wiry
moustache
into
his
tankard
for
a
space
Perhaps
not
I
said
He
was
an
author
you
see
and
he
wrote
a
lot
of
books
Indeed!
That
was
the
trouble
of
it
all
He
stared
at
me
with
the
available
eye
to
see
if
I
grasped
his
statement
then
averted
his
face
a
little
and
produced
a
toothpick
You
see
he
said
smacking
his
lips
after
a
pause
it
was
like
this
He
was
my
unclemy
maternal
uncle
And
he
hadwhat
shall
I
call
ita
weakness
for
writing
edifying
literature
Weakness
is
hardly
the
worddownright
mania
is
nearer
the
mark
Hed
been
librarian
in
a
Polytechnic
and
as
soon
as
the
money
came
to
him
he
began
to
indulge
his
ambition
Its
a
simply
extraordinary
and
incomprehensible
thing
to
me
Here
was
a
man
of
thirtyseven
suddenly
dropped
into
a
perfect
pile
of
gold
and
he
didnt
gonot
a
days
bust
on
it
One
would
think
a
chap
would
go
and
get
himself
dressed
a
bit
decentsay
a
couple
of
dozen
pairs
of
trousers
at
a
West
End
tailors
but
he
never
did
Youd
hardly
believe
it
but
when
he
died
he
hadnt
even
a
gold
watch
It
seems
wrong
for
people
like
that
to
have
money
All
he
did
was
just
to
take
a
house
and
order
in
pretty
nearly
five
tons
of
books
and
ink
and
paper
and
set
to
writing
edifying
literature
as
hard
as
ever
he
could
write
I
cant
understand
it!
But
he
did
The
money
came
to
him
curiously
enough
through
a
maternal
uncle
of
his
unexpected
like
when
he
was
sevenandthirty
My
mother
it
happened
was
his
only
relation
in
the
wide
wide
world
except
some
second
cousins
of
his
And
I
was
her
only
son
You
follow
all
that
The
second
cousins
had
one
only
son
too
but
they
brought
him
to
see
the
old
man
too
soon
He
was
rather
a
spoilt
youngster
was
this
son
of
theirs
and
directly
he
set
eyes
on
my
uncle
he
began
bawling
out
as
hard
as
he
could
Take
im
awayer
he
says
take
im
away
and
so
did
for
himself
entirely
It
was
pretty
straight
sailing
youd
think
for
me
eh
And
my
mother
being
a
sensible
careful
woman
settled
the
business
in
her
own
mind
long
before
he
did
He
was
a
curious
little
chap
was
my
uncle
as
I
remember
him
I
dont
wonder
at
the
kid
being
scared
Hair
just
like
these
Japanese
dolls
they
sell
black
and
straight
and
stiff
all
round
the
brim
and
none
in
the
middle
and
below
a
whitish
kind
of
face
and
rather
large
dark
grey
eyes
moving
about
behind
his
spectacles
He
used
to
attach
a
great
deal
of
importance
to
dress
and
always
wore
a
flapping
overcoat
and
a
bigbrimmed
felt
hat
of
a
most
extraordinary
size
He
looked
a
rummy
little
beggar
I
can
tell
you
Indoors
it
was
as
a
rule
a
dirty
red
flannel
dressinggown
and
a
black
skullcap
he
had
That
black
skullcap
made
him
look
like
the
portraits
of
all
kinds
of
celebrated
people
He
was
always
moving
about
from
house
to
house
was
my
uncle
with
his
chair
which
had
belonged
to
Savage
Landor
and
his
two
writingtables
one
of
Carlyles
and
the
other
of
Shelleys
so
the
dealer
told
him
and
the
completest
portable
reference
library
in
England
he
said
he
hadand
he
lugged
the
whole
caravan
now
to
a
house
at
Down
near
Darwins
old
place
then
to
Reigate
near
Meredith
then
off
to
Haslemere
then
back
to
Chelsea
for
a
bit
and
then
up
to
Hampstead
He
knew
there
was
something
wrong
with
his
stuff
but
he
never
knew
there
was
anything
wrong
with
his
brains
It
was
always
the
air
or
the
water
or
the
altitude
or
some
tommyrot
like
that
So
much
depends
on
environment
he
used
to
say
and
stare
at
you
hard
as
if
he
half
suspected
you
were
hiding
a
grin
at
him
somewhere
under
your
face
So
much
depends
on
environment
to
a
sensitive
mind
like
mine
What
was
his
name
You
wouldnt
know
it
if
I
told
you
He
wrote
nothing
that
anyone
has
ever
readnothing
No
one
could
read
it
He
wanted
to
be
a
great
teacher
he
said
and
he
didnt
know
what
he
wanted
to
teach
any
more
than
a
child
So
he
just
blethered
at
large
about
Truth
and
Righteousness
and
the
Spirit
of
History
and
all
that
Book
after
book
he
wrote
and
published
at
his
own
expense
He
wasnt
quite
right
in
his
head
you
know
really
and
to
hear
him
go
on
at
the
criticsnot
because
they
slated
him
mind
youhe
liked
thatbut
because
they
didnt
take
any
notice
of
him
at
all
What
do
the
nations
want
he
would
ask
holding
out
his
brown
old
claw
Why
teachingguidance!
They
are
scattered
upon
the
hills
like
sheep
without
a
shepherd
There
is
War
and
Rumours
of
War
the
unlaid
Spirit
of
Discord
abroad
in
the
land
Nihilism
Vivisection
Vaccination
Drunkenness
Penury
Want
Socialistic

Selfish
Capital!
Do

the
clouds
TedMy
name
you
knowDo
you
see
the
clouds
lowering

and
behind
it
allthe
Mongol
waits!
He
was
always
very
great
on
Mongols
and
the
Spectre
of
Socialism
and
suchlike
things
Then
out
would
come
his
finger
at
me
and
with
his
eyes
all
afire
and
his
skullcap
askew
he
would
whisper
And
here
am
I
What

Nations!
I
say
it
with
all
modesty
Ted
I
could
I
would

but
I
will
guide
them
to
a
safe
haven
to
the
land
of
Righteousness
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
Thats
how
he
used
to
go
on
Ramble
rave
about
the
nations
and
righteousness
and
that
kind
of
thing
Kind
of
mincemeat
of
Bible
and
blethers
From
fourteen
up
to
threeandtwenty
when
I
might
have
been
improving
my
mind
my
mother
used
to
wash
me
and
brush
my
hair
at
least
in
the
earlier
years
of
it
with
a
nice
parting
down
the
middle
and
take
me
once
or
twice
a
week
to
hear
this
old
lunatic
jabber
about
things
he
had
read
of
in
the
morning
papers
trying
to
do
it
as
much
like
Carlyle
as
he
could
and
I
used
to
sit
according
to
instructions
and
look
intelligent
and
nice
and
pretend
to
be
taking
it
all
in
Afterwards
I
used
to
go
of
my
own
free
will
out
of
a
regard
for
the
legacy
I
was
the
only
person
that
used
to
go
and
see
him
He
wrote
I
believe
to
every
man
who
made
the
slightest
stir
in
the
world
sending
him
a
copy
or
so
of
his
books
and
inviting
him
to
come
and
talk
about
the
nations
to
him
but
half
of
them
didnt
answer
and
none
ever
came
And
when
the

were

people
And
one
went
up
the
staircase
and
along
the
cobwebby
passagethe
housekeeper
drank
like
fury
and
his
passages
were
always
cobwebbyand
found
him

heaps

empty

and
halfeaten

Youd
see

up

be

out
quite
straight
between

collar
of

hundred
pages
or
so
with
cockeyed
headings
The
Shrieking
Sisterhood
The
Behemoth
of
Bigotry
Crucibles
and
Cullenders
and
so
on
All
very
strong
and
none
of
them
original
The
very
last
time
but
one
that
I
saw
him
he
gave
me
a
book
He
was
feeling
ill
even
then
and
his
hand
shook
and
he
was
despondent
I
noticed
it
because
I
was
naturally
on
the
lookout
for
those
little
symptoms
My
last
book
Ted
he
said
My
last
book
my
boy
my
last
word
to
the
deaf
and
hardened
nations
and
Im
hanged
if
a
tear
didnt
go
rolling
down
his
yellow
old
cheek
He
was
regular
crying
because
it
was
so
nearly
over
and
he
hadnt
only
written
about
fiftythree
books
of
rubbish
Ive
sometimes
thought
Tedhe
said
and
stopped
Perhaps
Ive
been
a
bit
hasty
and
angry
with
this
stiffnecked
generation
A
little
more
sweetness
perhaps
and
a
little
less
blinding
light
Ive
sometimes
thoughtI
might
have
swayed
them
But
Ive
done
my
best
Ted
And
then
with
a
burst
for
the
first
and
last
time
in
his
life
he
owned
himself
a
failure
It
showed
he
was
really
ill
He
seemed
to
think
for
a
minute
and
then
he
spoke
quietly
and
low
as
sane
and
sober
as
I
am
now
Ive
been
a
fool
Ted
he
said
Ive
been
flapping
nonsense
all
my
life
Only
He
who
readeth
the
heart
knows
whether
this
is
anything
more
than
vanity
Ted
I
dont
But
He
knows
He
knows
and
if
I
have
done
foolishly
and
vainly
in
my
heartin
my
heart
Just
like
that
he
spoke
repeating
himself
and
he
stopped
quite
short
and
handed
the
book
to
me
trembling
Then
the
old
shine
came
back
into
his
eye
I
remember
it
all
fairly
well
because
I
repeated
it
and
acted
it
to
my
old
mother
when
I
got
home
to
cheer
her
up
a
bit
Take
this
book
and
read
it
he
said
Its
my
last
word
my
very
last
word
Ive
left
all
my
property
to
you
Ted
and
may
you
use
it
better
than
I
have
done
And
then
he
fell
acoughing
I
remember
that
quite
well
even
now
and
how
I
went
home
cockahoop
and
how
he
was
in
bed
the
next
time
I
called
The
housekeeper
was
downstairs
drunk
and
I
fooled
aboutas
a
young
man
willwith
the
girl
in
the
passage
before
I
went
to
him
He
was
sinking
fast
But
even
then
his
vanity
clung
to
him
Have
you
read
it
he
whispered
Sat
up
all
night
reading
it
I
said
in
his
ear
to
cheer
him
Its
the
last
said
I
and
then
with
a
memory
of
some
poetry
or
other
in
my
head
but
its
the
bravest
and
best
He
smiled
a
little
and
tried
to
squeeze
my
hand
as
a
woman
might
do
and
left
off
squeezing
in
the
middle
and
lay
still
The
bravest
and
the
best
said
I
again
seeing
it
pleased
him
But
he
didnt
answer
I
heard
the
girl
giggle
outside
the
door
for
occasionally
wed
had
just
a
bit
of
innocent
laughter
you
know
at
his
ways
I
looked
at
his
face
and
his
eyes
were
closed
and
it
was
just
as
if
somebody
had
punched
in
his
nose
on
either
side
But
he
was
still
smiling
Its
queer
to
think
ofhe
lay
dead
lay
dead
there
an
utter
failure
with
the
smile
of
success
on
his
face
That
was
the
end
of
my
uncle
You
can
imagine
me
and
my
mother
saw
that
he
had
a
decent
funeral
Then
of
course
came
the
hunt
for
the
will
We
began
decent
and
respectful
at
first
and
before
the
day
was
out
we
were
ripping
chairs
and
smashing
bureau
panels
and
sounding
walls
Every
hour
we
expected
those
others
to
come
in
We
asked
the
housekeeper
and
found
shed
actually
witnessed
a
willon
an
ordinary
halfsheet
of
notepaper
it
was
written
and
very
short
she
saidnot
a
month
ago
The
other
witness
was
the
gardener
and
he
bore
her
out
word
for
word
But
Im
hanged
if
there
was
that
or
any
other
will
to
be
found
The
way
my
mother
talked
must
have
made
him
turn
in
his
grave
At
last
a
lawyer
at
Reigate
sprang
one
on
us
that
had
been
made
years
ago
during
some
temporary
quarrel
with
my
mother
Im
blest
if
that
wasnt
the
only
will
to
be
discovered
anywhere
and
it
left
every
penny
he
possessed
to
that
Take
im
away
youngster
of
his
second
cousinsa
chap
whod
never
had
to
stand
his
talking
not
for
one
afternoon
of
his
life
The
man
with
the
glass
eye
stopped
I
thought
you
saidI
began
Half
a
minute
said
the
man
with
the
glass
eye
I
had
to
wait
for
the
end
of
the
story
till
this
very
morning
and
I
was
a
blessed
sight
more
interested
than
you
are
You
just
wait
a
bit
too
They
executed
the
will
and
the
other
chap
inherited
and
directly
he
was
oneandtwenty
he
began
to
blew
it
How
he
did
blew
it
to
be
sure!
He
bet
he
drank
he
got
in
the
papers
for
this
and
that
I
tell
you
it
makes
me
wriggle
to
think
of
the
times
he
had
He
blewed
every
hapenny
of
it
before
he
was
thirty
and
the
last
I
heard
of
him
wasHolloway!
Three
years
ago
Well
I
naturally
fell
on
hard
times
because
as
you
see
the
only
trade
I
knew
was
legacycadging
All
my
plans
were
waiting
over
to
begin
so
to
speak
when
the
old
chap
died
Ive
had
my
ups
and
downs
since
then
Just
now
its
a
period
of
depression
I
tell
you
frankly
Im
on
the
lookout
for
help
I
was
hunting
round
my
room
to
find
something
to
raise
a
bit
on
for
immediate
necessities
and
the
sight
of
all
those
presentation
volumesno
one
will
buy
them
not
to
wrap
butter
in
evenwell
they
annoyed
me
Id
promised
him
not
to
part
with
them
and
I
never
kept
a
promise
easier
I
let
out
at
them
with
my
boot
and
sent
them
shooting
across
the
room
One
lifted
at
the
kick
and
spun
through
the
air
And
out
of
it
flappedYou
guess
It
was
the
will
Hed
given
it
me
himself
in
that
very
last
volume
of
all
He
folded
his
arms
on
the
table
and
looked
sadly
with
the
active
eye
at
his
empty
tankard
He
shook
his
head
slowly
and
said
softly
Id
never
opened
the
book
much
more
cut
a
page!
Then
he
looked
up
with
a
bitter
laugh
for
my
sympathy
Fancy
hiding
it
there!
Eigh
Of
all
places
He
began
to
fish
absently
for
a
dead
fly
with
his
finger
It
just
shows
you
the
vanity
of
authors
he
said
looking
up
at
me
It
wasnt
no
trick
of
his
Hed
meant
perfectly
fair
Hed
really
thought
I
was
really
going
home
to
read
that
blessed
book
of
his
through
But
it
shows
you
dont
ithis
eye
went
down
to
the
tankard
againIt
shows
you
too
how
we
poor
human
beings
fail
to
understand
one
another
But
there
was
no
misunderstanding
the
eloquent
thirst
of
his
eye
He
accepted
with
illfeigned
surprise
He
said
in
the
usual
subtle
formula
that
he
didnt
mind
if
he
did

Cummins!
In
the
past
I
should
have
disliked
writing
anything
quite
so
full
of
I
as
this
story
must
be
It
is
full
of
Is

a

I

But
my
tastes
have
changed
since
I
became
a
Dramatic
Critic
and
studied
the
mastersGRS
GBS
GAS
and
the
others
Everything
has
changed
since
then
At
least
the
story
is
about
myselfso
that
there
is
some
excuse
for
me
And
it
is
really
not
egotism
because
as
I
say
since
those
days
my
identity
has
undergone
an
entire
alteration

All
gone

And
her
father
liked
me
because
I
seemed
honestly
eager
to
hear
about

She
had
no

Indeed
I
had
the
happiest
prospects
a
young
man
could
have
I
never
went
to
theatres
in
those
days
My
Aunt

Then

Critic
He
is
a
fine
healthy
man
Barnaby
with
an
enormous
head
of
frizzy
black
hair
and
a
convincing
manner
and
he
caught
me
on
the
staircase
going
to
see
Wembly
He
had
been
dining
and
was
more
than
usually
buoyant
Hullo
Cummins!
he
said
The
very
man
I
want!
He
caught
me
by
the
shoulder
or
the
collar
or
something
ran
me
up
the
little
passage
and
flung
me
over
the
wastepaper
basket
into
the
armchair
in
his
office
Pray
be
seated
he
said
as
he
did
so
Then
he
ran
across
the
room
and
came
back
with
some
pink
and
yellow
tickets
and
pushed
them
into
my
hand

he
said
snatching
some
proofs
off
the
desk
and
beginning
to
read
I
dont
quite
understand
I
said
Eigh
he
said
at
the
top
of
his
voice
as
though
he
thought
I
had
gone
and
was
startled
at
my
remark
Do
you
want
me
to
criticise

plays
Do

Did
you
think
it
was

Well
Ive
never

But

He
caught
me
up
suddenly
and
put
me
outside
his
door
Go
and
talk
to
Wembly
about
that
he
said
Hell
explain
As
I
stood
perplexed
he
opened
the
door
again
said
I
forgot
this
thrust
a
fourth
ticket
into
my
hand
it
was
for
that
nightin
twenty
minutes
time
and
slammed
the
door
upon
me
His
expression
was
quite
calm
but
I
caught
his
eye
I
hate

I
decided
that
I
would
take
his
hint
and
become
to
my
own
destruction
a
Dramatic
Critic
I
walked
slowly
down
the
passage
to
Wembly
That
Barnaby
has
a
remarkably
persuasive
way
He
has
made
few
suggestions
during
our
very
pleasant
intercourse
of
four
years
that
he
has
not
ultimately
won
me
round
to
adopting
It
may
be
of
course
that
I
am
of
a
yielding
disposition
certainly
I
am
too
apt
to
take
my
colour
from
my
circumstances
It
is
indeed
to
my
unfortunate
susceptibility
to
vivid
impressions
that
all
my
misfortunes
are
due
I
have
already
alluded
to
the
slight
stammer
I
had
acquired
from
a
schoolfellow
in
my
youth
However
this
is
a
digression
I
went
home
in
a
cab
to
dress
I
will
not
trouble
the
reader
with
my
thoughts
about
the
firstnight
audience
strange
assembly
as
it
isthose
I
reserve
for
my
Memoirsnor
the
humiliating
story
of
how
I
got
lost
during
the
entracte
in
a
lot
of
red
plush
passages
and
saw
the
third
act
from
the
gallery
The
only
point
upon
which
I
wish
to
lay
stress
was
the
remarkable
effect
of
the
acting
upon
me
You
must
remember
I
had
lived
a
quiet
and
retired
life
and
had
never
been
to
the
theatre
before
and
that
I
am
extremely
sensitive
to
vivid
impressions
At
the
risk
of
repetition
I
must
insist
upon
these
points
The
first
effect
was
a
profound
amazement
not
untinctured
by
alarm
The
phenomenal
unnaturalness
of
acting
is
a
thing
discounted
in
the
minds
of
most
people
by
early
visits
to
the
theatre
They
get
used
to
the
fantastic
gestures
the
flamboyant
emotions
the
weird
mouthings
melodious
snortings
agonising
yelps
lipgnawings
glaring
horrors
and
other
emotional
symbolism
of
the
stage
It
becomes
at
last
a
mere
deafanddumb
language
to
them
which
they
read
intelligently
pari
passu
with
the
hearing
of
the
dialogue
But
all
this
was
new
to
me
The
thing
was
called
a
modern
comedy
the
people
were
supposed
to
be
English
and
were
dressed
like
fashionable
Americans
of
the
current
epoch
and
I
fell
into
the
natural
error
of
supposing
that
the
actors
were
trying
to
represent
human
beings
I
looked
round
on
my
firstnight
audience
with
a
kind
of
wonder
discoveredas
all
new
Dramatic
Critics
dothat
it
rested
with
me
to
reform
the
Drama
and
after
a
supper
choked
with
emotion
went
off
to
the
office
to
write
a
column
piebald
with
new
paragraphs
as
all
my
stuff
isit
fills
out
so
and
purple
with
indignation
Barnaby
was
delighted
But
I
could
not
sleep
that
night
I
dreamt
of
actorsactors
glaring
actors
smiting
their
chests
actors
flinging
out
a
handful
of
extended
fingers
actors
smiling
bitterly
laughing
despairingly
falling
hopelessly
dying
idiotically
I
got
up
at
eleven
with
a
slight
headache
read
my
notice
in
the
Fiery
Cross
breakfasted
and
went
back
to
my
room
to
shave
Its
my
habit
to
do
so
Then
an
odd
thing
happened
I
could
not
find
my
razor
Suddenly
it
occurred
to
me
that
I
had
not
unpacked
it
the
day
before
Ah!
said
I
in
front
of
the
lookingglass
Then
Hullo!
Quite
involuntarily
when
I
had
thought
of
my
portmanteau
I
had
flung
up
the
left
arm
fingers
fully
extended
and
clutched
at
my
diaphragm
with
my
right
hand
I
am
an
acutely
selfconscious
man
at
all
times
The
gesture
struck
me
as
absolutely
novel
for
me
I
repeated
it
for
my
own
satisfaction
Odd!
Then
rather
puzzled
I
turned
to
my
portmanteau
After
shaving
my
mind
reverted
to
the
acting
I
had
seen
and
I
entertained
myself
before
the
cheval
glass
with
some
imitations
of
Jafferays
more
exaggerated
gestures
Really
one
might
think
it
a
disease
I
saidStageWalkitis!
Theres
many
a
truth
spoken
in
jest
Then
if
I
remember
rightly
I
went
off
to
see
Wembly
and
afterwards
lunched
at
the
British
Museum
with
Delia
We
actually
spoke
about
our
prospects
in
the
light
of
my
new
appointment
But
that
appointment
was
the
beginning
of
my
downfall
From
that
day
I
necessarily
became
a
persistent
theatregoer
and
almost
insensibly
I
began
to
change
The
next
thing
I
noticed
after
the
gesture
about
the
razor
was
to
catch
myself
bowing
ineffably
when
I
met
Delia
and
stooping
in
an
oldfashioned
courtly
way
over
her
hand
Directly
I
caught
myself
I
straightened
myself
up
and
became
very
uncomfortable
I
remember
she
looked
at
me
curiously
Then
in
the
office
I
found
myself
doing
nervous
business
fingers
on
teeth
when
Barnaby
asked
me
a
question
I
could
not
very
well
answer
Then
in
some
trifling
difference
with
Delia
I
clasped
my
hand
to
my
brow
And
I
pranced
through
my
social
transactions
at
times
singularly
like
an
actor!
I
tried
not
tono
one
could
be
more
keenly
alive
to
the
arrant
absurdity
of
the
histrionic
bearing
And
I
did!
It
began
to
dawn
on
me
what
it
all
meant
The
acting
I
saw
was
too
much
for
my
delicatelystrung
nervous
system
I
have
always
I
know
been
too
amenable
to
the
suggestions
of
my
circumstances
Night
after
night
of
concentrated
attention
to
the
conventional
attitudes
and
intonation
of
the
English
stage
was
gradually
affecting
my
speech
and
carriage
I
was
giving
way
to
the
infection
of
sympathetic
imitation
Night
after
night
my
plastic
nervous
system
took
the
print
of
some
new
amazing
gesture
some
new
emotional
exaggerationand
retained
it
A
kind
of
theatrical
veneer
threatened
to
plate
over
and
obliterate
my
private
individuality
altogether
I
saw
myself
in
a
kind
of
vision
Sitting
by
myself
one
night
my
new
self
seemed
to
me
to
glide
posing
and
gesticulating
across
the
room
He
clutched
his
throat
he
opened
his
fingers
he
opened
his
legs
in
walking
like
a
highclass
marionette
He
went
from
attitude
to
attitude
He
might
have
been
clockwork
Directly
after
this
I
made
an
ineffectual
attempt
to
resign
my
theatrical
work
But
Barnaby
persisted
in
talking
about
the
Polywhiddle
Divorce
all
the
time
I
was
with
him
and
I
could
get
no
opportunity
of
saying
what
I
wished
And
then
Delias
manner
began
to
change
towards
me
The
ease
of
our
intercourse
vanished
I
felt
she
was
learning
to
dislike
me
I
grinned
and
capered
and
scowled
and
posed
at
her
in
a
thousand
ways
and
knewwith
what
a
voiceless
agony!that
I
did
it
all
the
time
I
tried
to
resign
again
and
Barnaby
talked
about
X
and
Z
and
Y
in
the
New
Review
and
gave
me
a
strong
cigar
to
smoke
and
so
routed
me
And
then
I
walked
up
the
Assyrian
Gallery
in
the
manner
of
Irving
to
meet
Delia
and
so
precipitated
the
crisis
Ah!Dear!
I
said
with
more
sprightliness
and
emotion
in
my
voice
than
had
ever
been
in
all
my
life
before
I
became
to
my
own
undoing
a
Dramatic
Critic
She
held
out
her
hand
rather
coldly
scrutinising
my
face
as
she
did
so
I
prepared
with
a
newwon
grace
to
walk
by
her
side
Egbert
she
said
standing
still
and
thought
Then
she
looked
at
me
I
said
nothing
I
felt
what
was
coming
I
tried
to
be
the
old
Egbert
Craddock
Cummins
of
shambling
gait
and
stammering
sincerity
whom
she
loved
but
I
felt
even
as
I
did
so
that
I
was
a
new
thing
a
thing
of
surging
emotions
and
mysterious
fixitylike
no
human
being
that
ever
lived
except
upon
the
stage
Egbert
she
said
you
are
not
yourself
Ah!
Involuntarily
I
clutched
my
diaphragm
and
averted
my
head
as
is
the
way
with
them
There!
she
said
What
do
you
mean
I
said
whispering
in
vocal
italicsyou
know
how
they
do
itturning
on
her
perplexity
on
face
right
hand
down
left
on
brow
I
knew
quite
well
what
she
meant
I
knew
quite
well
the
dramatic
unreality
of
my
behaviour
But
I
struggled
against
it
in
vain
What
do
you
mean
I
said
and
in
a
kind
of
hoarse
whisper
I
dont
understand!
She
really
looked
as
though
she
disliked
me
What
do
you
keep
on
posing
for
she
said
I
dont
like
it
You
didnt
use
to
Didnt
use
to!
I
said
slowly
repeating
this
twice
I
glared
up
and
down
the
gallery
with
short
sharp
glances
We
are
alone
I
said
swiftly
Listen!
I
poked
my
forefinger
towards
her
and
glared
at
her
I
am
under
a
curse
I
saw
her
hand
tighten
upon
her
sunshade
You
are
under
some
bad
influence
or
other
said
Delia
You
should
give
it
up
I
never
knew
anyone
change
as
you
have
done
Delia!
I
said
lapsing
into
the
pathetic
Pity
me
Augh!
Delia!
Pity
me!
She
eyed
me
critically
Why
you
keep
playing
the
fool
like
this
I
dont
know
she
said
Anyhow
I
really
cannot
go
about
with
a
man
who
behaves
as
you
do
You
made
us
both
ridiculous
on
Wednesday
Frankly
I
dislike
you
as
you
are
now
I
met
you
here
to
tell
you
soas
its
about
the
only
place
where
we
can
be
sure
of
being
alone
together
Delia!
said
I
with
intensity
knuckles
of
clenched
hands
white
You
dont
mean
I
do
said
Delia
A
womans
lot
is
sad
enough
at
the
best
of
times
But
with
you
I
clapped
my
hand
on
my
brow
So
goodbye
said
Delia
without
emotion
Oh
Delia!
I
said
Not
this
Goodbye
Mr
Cummins
she
said
By
a
violent
effort
I
controlled
myself
and
touched
her
hand
I
tried
to
say
some
word
of
explanation
to
her
She
looked
into
my
working
face
and
winced
I
must
do
it
she
said
hopelessly
Then
she
turned
from
me
and
began
walking
rapidly
down
the
gallery
Heavens!
How
the
human
agony
cried
within
me!
I
loved
Delia
But
nothing
found
expressionI
was
already
too
deeply
crusted
with
my
acquired
self
Goodbaye!
I
said
at
last
watching
her
retreating
figure
How
I
hated
myself
for
doing
it!
After
she
had
vanished
I
repeated
in
a
dreamy
way
Goodbaye!
looking
hopelessly
round
me
Then
with
a
kind
of
heartbroken
cry
I
shook
my
clenched
fists
in
the
air
staggered
to
the
pedestal
of
a
winged
figure
buried
my
face
in
my
arms
and
made
my
shoulders
heave
Something
within
me
said
Ass!
as
I
did
so
I
had
the
greatest
difficulty
in
persuading
the
Museum
policeman
who
was
attracted
by
my
cry
of
agony
that
I
was
not
intoxicated
but
merely
suffering
from
a
transient
indisposition
But
even
this
great
sorrow
has
not
availed
to
save
me
from
my
fate
I
see
it
everyone
sees
it
I
grow
more
theatrical
every
day
And
no
one
could
be
more
painfully
aware
of
the
pungent
silliness
of
theatrical
ways
The
quiet
nervous
but
pleasing
E
C
Cummins
vanishes
I
cannot
save
him
I
am
driven
like
a
dead
leaf
before
the
winds
of
March
My
tailor
even
enters
into
the
spirit
of
my
disorder
He
has
a
peculiar
sense
of
what
is
fitting
I
tried
to
get
a
dull
grey
suit
from
him
this
spring
and
he
foisted
a
brilliant
blue
upon
me
and
I
see
he
has
put
braid
down
the
sides
of
my
new
dress
trousers
My
hairdresser
insists
upon
giving
me
a
wave
I
am
beginning
to
associate
with
actors
I
detest
them
but
it
is
only
in
their
company
that
I
can
feel
I
am
not
glaringly
conspicuous
Their
talk
infects
me
I
notice
a
growing
tendency
to
dramatic
brevity
to
dashes
and
pauses
in
my
style
to
a
punctuation
of
bows
and
attitudes
Barnaby
has
remarked
it
too
I
offended
Wembly
by
calling
him
Dear
Boy
yesterday
I
dread
the
end
but
I
cannot
escape
from
it
The
fact
is
I
am
being
obliterated
Living
a
grey
retired
life
all
my
youth
I
came
to
the
theatre
a
delicate
sketch
of
a
man
a
thing
of
tints
and
faint
lines
Their
gorgeous
colouring
has
effaced
me
altogether
People
forget
how
much
mode
of
expression
method
of
movement
are
a
matter
of
contagion
I
have
heard
of
stagestruck
people
before
and
thought
it
a
figure
of
speech
I
spoke
of
it
jestingly
as
a
disease
It
is
no
jest
It
is
a
disease
And
I
have
got
it
bad!
Deep
down
within
me
I
protest
against
the
wrong
done
to
my
personalityunavailingly
For
three
hours
or
more
a
week
I
have
to
go
and
concentrate
my
attention
on
some
fresh
play
and
the
suggestions
of
the
drama
strengthen
their
awful
hold
upon
me
My
manners
grow
so
flamboyant
my
passions
so
professional
that
I
doubt
as
I
said
at
the
outset
whether
it
is
really
myself
that
behaves
in
such
a
manner
I
feel
merely
the
core
to
this
dramatic
casing
that
grows
thicker
and
presses
upon
meme
and
mine
I
feel
like
King
Johns
abbot
in
his
cope
of
lead
I
doubt
indeed
whether
I
should
not
abandon
the
struggle
altogetherleave
this
sad
world
of
ordinary
life
for
which
I
am
so
illfitted
abandon
the
name
of
Cummins
for
some
professional
pseudonym
complete
my
selfeffacement
anda
thing
of
tricks
and
tatters
of
posing
and
pretencego
upon
the
stage
It
seems
my
only
resortto
hold
the
mirror
up
to
Nature
For
in
the
ordinary
life
I
will
confess
no
one
now
seems
to
regard
me
as
both
sane
and
sober
Only
upon
the
stage
I
feel
convinced
will
people
take
me
seriously
That
will
be
the
end
of
it
I
know
that
will
be
the
end
of
it
And
yet

I
will
frankly
confess

all
that
marks
off
your
actor
from
your
common
man

I
detest
I
am
still
largely
of
my
Aunt
Charlottes
opinion
that
playacting
is
unworthy
of
a
pureminded
mans
attention
much
more
participation
Even
now
I
would
resign
my
dramatic
criticism
and
try
a
rest
Only
I
cant
get
hold
of
Barnaby
Letters
of
resignation
he
never
notices
He
says
it
is
against
the
etiquette
of
journalism
to
write
to
your
Editor
And
when
I
go
to
see
him
he
gives
me
another
big
cigar
and
some
strong
whisky
and
soda
and
then
something
always
turns
up
to
prevent
my
explanation
A
SLIP
UNDER
THE
MICROSCOPE
Outside
the
laboratory
windows
was
a
waterygrey
fog
and
within
a
close
warmth
and
the
yellow
light
of
the
greenshaded
gas
lamps
that
stood
two
to
each
table
down
its
narrow
length
On
each
table
stood
a
couple
of
glass
jars
containing
the
mangled
vestiges
of
the
crayfish
mussels
frogs
and
guineapigs
upon
which
the
students
had
been
working
and
down
the
side
of
the
room
facing
the
windows
were
shelves
bearing
bleached
dissections
in
spirits
surmounted
by
a
row
of
beautifully
executed
anatomical
drawings
in
whitewood
frames
and
overhanging
a
row
of
cubical
lockers
All
the
doors
of
the
laboratory
were
panelled
with
blackboard
and
on
these
were
the
halferased
diagrams
of
the
previous
days
work
The
laboratory
was
empty
save
for
the
demonstrator
who
sat
near
the
preparationroom
door
and
silent
save
for
a
low
continuous
murmur
and
the
clicking
of
the
rocker
microtome
at
which
he
was
working
But
scattered
about
the
room
were
traces
of
numerous
students
handbags
polished
boxes
of
instruments
in
one
place
a
large
drawing
covered
by
newspaper
and
in
another
a
prettily
bound
copy
of
News
from
Nowhere
a
book
oddly
at
variance
with
its
surroundings
These
things
had
been
put
down
hastily
as
the
students
had
arrived
and
hurried
at
once
to
secure
their
seats
in
the
adjacent
lecture
theatre
Deadened
by
the
closed
door
the
measured
accents
of
the
professor
sounded
as
a
featureless
muttering
Presently
faint
through
the
closed
windows
came
the
sound
of
the
Oratory
clock
striking
the
hour
of
eleven
The
clicking
of
the
microtome
ceased
and
the
demonstrator
looked
at
his
watch
rose
thrust
his
hands
into
his
pockets
and
walked
slowly
down
the
laboratory
towards
the
lecture
theatre
door
He
stood
listening
for
a
moment
and
then
his
eye
fell
on
the
little
volume
by
William
Morris
He
picked
it
up
glanced
at
the
title
smiled
opened
it
looked
at
the
name
on
the
flyleaf
ran
the
leaves
through
with
his
hand
and
put
it
down
Almost
immediately
the
even
murmur
of
the
lecturer
ceased
there
was
a
sudden
burst
of
pencils
rattling
on
the
desks
in
the
lecture
theatre
a
stirring
a
scraping
of
feet
and
a
number
of
voices
speaking
together
Then
a
firm
footfall
approached
the
door
which
began
to
open
and
stood
ajar
as
some
indistinctly
heard
question
arrested
the
newcomer
The
demonstrator
turned
walked
slowly
back
past
the
microtome
and
left
the
laboratory
by
the
preparationroom
door
As
he
did
so
first
one
and
then
several
students
carrying
notebooks
entered
the
laboratory
from
the
lecture
theatre
and
distributed
themselves
among
the
little
tables
or
stood
in
a
group
about
the
doorway
They
were
an
exceptionally
heterogeneous
assembly
for
while
Oxford
and
Cambridge
still
recoil
from
the
blushing
prospect
of
mixed
classes
the
College
of
Science
anticipated
America
in
the
matter
years
agomixed
socially
too
for
the
prestige
of
the
College
is
high
and
its
scholarships
free
of
any
age
limit
dredge
deeper
even
than
do
those
of
the
Scotch
universities
The
class
numbered
oneandtwenty
but
some
remained
in
the
theatre
questioning
the
professor
copying
the
blackboard
diagrams
before
they
were
washed
off
or
examining
the
special
specimens
he
had
produced
to
illustrate
the
days
teaching
Of
the
nine
who
had
come
into
the
laboratory
three
were
girls
one
of
whom
a
little
fair
woman
wearing
spectacles
and
dressed
in
greyishgreen
was
peering
out
of
the
window
at
the
fog
while
the
other
two
both
wholesomelooking
plainfaced
schoolgirls
unrolled
and
put
on
the
brown
holland
aprons
they
wore
while
dissecting
Of
the
men
two
went
down
the
laboratory
to
their
places
one
a
pallid
darkbearded
man
who
had
once
been
a
tailor
the
other
a
pleasantfeatured
ruddy
young
man
of
twenty
dressed
in
a
wellfitting
brown
suit
young
Wedderburn
the
son
of
Wedderburn
the
eye
specialist
The
others
formed
a
little
knot
near
the
theatre
door
One
of
these
a
dwarfed
spectacled
figure
with
a
hunch
back
sat
on
a
bent
wood
stool
two
others
one
a
short
dark
youngster
and
the
other
a
flaxenhaired
reddishcomplexioned
young
man
stood
leaning
side
by
side
against
the
slate
sink
while
the
fourth
stood
facing
them
and
maintained
the
larger
share
of
the
conversation
This
last
person
was
named
Hill
He
was
a
sturdily
built
young
fellow
of
the
same
age
as
Wedderburn
he
had
a
white
face
dark
grey
eyes
hair
of
an
indeterminate
colour
and
prominent
irregular
features
He
talked
rather
louder
than
was
needful
and
thrust
his
hands
deeply
into
his
pockets
His
collar
was
frayed
and
blue
with
the
starch
of
a
careless
laundress
his
clothes
were
evidently
readymade
and
there
was
a
patch
on
the
side
of
his
boot
near
the
toe
And
as
he
talked
or
listened
to
the
others
he
glanced
now
and
again
towards
the
lecture
theatre
door
They
were
discussing
the
depressing
peroration
of
the
lecture
they
had
just
heard
the
last
lecture
it
was
in
the
introductory
course
in
zoology
From
ovum
to
ovum
is
the
goal
of
the
higher
vertebrata
the
lecturer
had
said
in
his
melancholy
tones
and
so
had
neatly
rounded
off
the
sketch
of
comparative
anatomy
he
had
been
developing
The
spectacled
hunchback
had
repeated
it
with
noisy
appreciation
had
tossed
it
towards
the
fairhaired
student
with
an
evident
provocation
and
had
started
one
of
those
vague
rambling
discussions
on
generalities
so
unaccountably
dear
to
the
student
mind
all
the
world
over
That
is
our
goal
perhapsI
admit
itas
far
as
science
goes
said
the
fairhaired
student
rising
to
the
challenge
But
there
are
things
above
science
Science
said
Hill
confidently
is
systematic
knowledge
Ideas
that
dont
come
into
the
systemmust
anyhowbe
loose
ideas
He
was
not
quite
sure
whether
that
was
a
clever
saying
or
a
fatuity
until
his
hearers
took
it
seriously
The
thing
I
cannot
understand
said
the
hunchback
at
large
is
whether
Hill
is
a
materialist
or
not
There
is
one
thing
above
matter
said
Hill
promptly
feeling
he
had
a
better
thing
this
time
aware
too
of
someone
in
the
doorway
behind
him
and
raising
his
voice
a
trifle
for
her
benefit
and
that
is
the
delusion
that
there
is
something
above
matter
So
we
have
your
gospel
at
last
said
the
fair
student
Its
all
a
delusion
is
it
All
our
aspirations
to
lead
something
more
than
dogs
lives
all
our
work
for
anything
beyond
ourselves
But
see
how
inconsistent
you
are
Your
socialism
for
instance
Why
do
you
trouble
about
the
interests
of
the
race
Why
do
you
concern
yourself
about
the
beggar
in
the
gutter
Why
are
you
bothering
yourself
to
lend
that
bookhe
indicated
William
Morris
by
a
movement
of
the
headto
everyone
in
the
lab
Girl
said
the
hunchback
indistinctly
and
glanced
guiltily
over
his
shoulder
The
girl
in
brown
with
the
brown
eyes
had
come
into
the
laboratory
and
stood
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
behind
him
with
her
rolledup
apron
in
one
hand
looking
over
her
shoulder
listening
to
the
discussion
She
did
not
notice
the
hunchback
because
she
was
glancing
from
Hill
to
his
interlocutor
Hills
consciousness
of
her
presence
betrayed
itself
to
her
only
in
his
studious
ignorance
of
the
fact
but
she
understood
that
and
it
pleased
her
I
see
no
reason
said
he
why
a
man
should
live
like
a
brute
because
he
knows
of
nothing
beyond
matter
and
does
not
expect
to
exist
a
hundred
years
hence
Why
shouldnt
he
said
the
fairhaired
student
Why
should
he
said
Hill
What
inducement
has
he
Thats
the
way
with
all
you
religious
people
Its
all
a
business
of
inducements
Cannot
a
man
seek
after
righteousness
for
righteousness
sake
There
was
a
pause
The
fair
man
answered
with
a
kind
of
vocal
padding
Butyou
seeinducementwhen
I
said
inducement
to
gain
time
And
then
the
hunchback
came
to
his
rescue
and
inserted
a
question
He
was
a
terrible
person
in
the
debating
society
with
his
questions
and
they
invariably
took
one
forma
demand
for
a
definition
Whats
your
definition
of
righteousness
said
the
hunchback
at
this
stage
Hill
experienced
a
sudden
loss
of
complacency
at
this
question
but
even
as
it
was
asked
relief
came
in
the
person
of
Brooks
the
laboratory
attendant
who
entered
by
the
preparationroom
door
carrying
a
number
of
freshly
killed
guineapigs
by
their
hind
legs
This
is
the
last
batch
of
material
this
session
said
the
youngster
who
had
not
previously
spoken
Brooks
advanced
up
the
laboratory
smacking
down
a
couple
of
guineapigs
at
each
table
The
rest
of
the
class
scenting
the
prey
from
afar
came
crowding
in
by
the
lecture
theatre
door
and
the
discussion
perished
abruptly
as
the
students
who
were
not
already
in
their
places
hurried
to
them
to
secure
the
choice
of
a
specimen
There
was
a
noise
of
keys
rattling
on
split
rings
as
lockers
were
opened
and
dissecting
instruments
taken
out
Hill
was
already
standing
by
his
table
and
his
box
of
scalpels
was
sticking
out
of
his
pocket
The
girl
in
brown
came
a
step
towards
him
and
leaning
over
his
table
said
softly
Did
you
see
that
I
returned
your
book
Mr
Hill
During
the
whole
scene
she
and
the
book
had
been
vividly
present
in
his
consciousness
but
he
made
a
clumsy
pretence
of
looking
at
the
book
and
seeing
it
for
the
first
time
Oh
yes
he
said
taking
it
up
I
see
Did
you
like
it
I
want
to
ask
you
some
questions
about
itsome
time
Certainly
said
Hill
I
shall
be
glad
He
stopped
awkwardly
You
liked
it
he
said
Its
a
wonderful
book
Only
some
things
I
dont
understand
Then
suddenly
the
laboratory
was
hushed
by
a
curious
braying
noise
It
was
the
demonstrator
He
was
at
the
blackboard
ready
to
begin
the
days
instruction
and
it
was
his
custom
to
demand
silence
by
a
sound
midway
between
the
Er
of
common
intercourse
and
the
blast
of
a
trumpet
The
girl
in
brown
slipped
back
to
her
place
it
was
immediately
in
front
of
Hills
and
Hill
forgetting
her
forthwith
took
a
notebook
out
of
the
drawer
of
his
table
turned
over
its
leaves
hastily
drew
a
stumpy
pencil
from
his
pocket
and
prepared
to
make
a
copious
note
of
the
coming
demonstration
For
demonstrations
and
lectures
are
the
sacred
text
of
the
College
students
Books
saving
only
the
Professors
own
you
mayit
is
even
expedient
toignore





Hill
was
the
son
of
a
Landport
cobbler
and
had
been
hooked
by
a
chance
blue
paper
the
authorities
had
thrown
out
to
the
Landport
Technical
College
He
kept
himself
in
London
on
his
allowance
of
a
guinea
a
week
and
found
that
with
proper
care
this
also
covered
his
clothing
allowance
an
occasional
waterproof
collar
that
is
and
ink
and
needles
and
cotton
and
suchlike
necessaries
for
a
man
about
town
This
was
his
first
year
and
his
first
session
but
the
brown
old
man
in
Landport
had
already
got
himself
detested
in
many
publichouses
by
boasting
of
his
son
the
Professor
Hill
was
a
vigorous
youngster
with
a
serene
contempt
for
the
clergy
of
all
denominations
and
a
fine
ambition
to
reconstruct
the
world
He
regarded
his
scholarship
as
a
brilliant
opportunity
He
had
begun
to
read
at
seven
and
had
read
steadily
whatever
came
in
his
way
good
or
bad
since
then
His
worldly
experience
had
been
limited
to
the
island
of
Portsea
and
acquired
chiefly
in
the
wholesale
boot
factory
in
which
he
had
worked
by
day
after
passing
the
seventh
standard
of
the
Board
school
He
had
a
considerable
gift
of
speech
as
the
College
Debating
Society
which
met
amidst
the
crushing
machines
and
mine
models
in
the
metallurgical
theatre
downstairs
already
recognisedrecognised
by
a
violent
battering
of
desks
whenever
he
rose
And
he
was
just
at
that
fine
emotional
age
when
life
opens
at
the
end
of
a
narrow
pass
like
a
broad
valley
at
ones
feet
full
of
the
promise
of
wonderful
discoveries
and
tremendous
achievements
And
his
own
limitations
save
that
he
knew
that
he
knew
neither
Latin
nor
French
were
all
unknown
to
him
At
first
his
interest
had
been
divided
pretty
equally
between
his
biological
work
at
the
College
and
social
and
theological
theorising
an
employment
which
he
took
in
deadly
earnest
Of
a
night
when
the
big
museum
library
was
not
open
he
would
sit
on
the
bed
of
his
room
in
Chelsea
with
his
coat
and
a
muffler
on
and
write
out
the
lecture
notes
and
revise
his
dissection
memoranda
until
Thorpe
called
him
out
by
a
whistlethe
landlady
objected
to
open
the
door
to
attic
visitorsand
then
the
two
would
go
prowling
about
the
shadowy
shiny
gaslit
streets
talking
very
much
in
the
fashion
of
the
sample
just
given
of
the
God
Idea
and
Righteousness
and
Carlyle
and
the
Reorganisation
of
Society
And
in
the
midst
of
it
all
Hill
arguing
not
only
for
Thorpe
but
for
the
casual
passerby
would
lose
the
thread
of
his
argument
glancing
at
some
pretty
painted
face
that
looked
meaningly
at
him
as
he
passed
Science
and
Righteousness!
But
once
or
twice
lately
there
had
been
signs
that
a
third
interest
was
creeping
into
his
life
and
he
had
found
his
attention
wandering
from
the
fate
of
the
mesoblastic
somites
or
the
probable
meaning
of
the
blastopore
to
the
thought
of
the
girl
with
the
brown
eyes
who
sat
at
the
table
before
him
She
was
a
paying
student
she
descended
inconceivable
social
altitudes
to
speak
to
him
At
the
thought
of
the
education
she
must
have
had
and
the
accomplishments
she
must
possess
the
soul
of
Hill
became
abject
within
him
She
had
spoken
to
him
first
over
a
difficulty
about
the
alisphenoid
of
a
rabbits
skull
and
he
had
found
that
in
biology
at
least
he
had
no
reason
for
selfabasement
And
from
that
after
the
manner
of
young
people
starting
from
any
startingpoint
they
got
to
generalities
and
while
Hill
attacked
her
upon
the
question
of
socialismsome
instinct
told
him
to
spare
her
a
direct
assault
upon
her
religionshe
was
gathering
resolution
to
undertake
what
she
told
herself
was
his
sthetic
education
She
was
a
year
or
two
older
than
he
though
the
thought
never
occurred
to
him
The
loan
of
News
from
Nowhere
was
the
beginning
of
a
series
of
cross
loans
Upon
some
absurd
first
principle
of
his
Hill
had
never
wasted
time
upon
poetry
and
it
seemed
an
appalling
deficiency
to
her
One
day
in
the
lunch
hour
when
she
chanced
upon
him
alone
in
the
little
museum
where
the
skeletons
were
arranged
shamefully
eating
the
bun
that
constituted
his
midday
meal
she
retreated
and
returned
to
lend
him
with
a
slightly
furtive
air
a
volume
of
Browning
He
stood
sideways
towards
her
and
took
the
book
rather
clumsily
because
he
was
holding
the
bun
in
the
other
hand
And
in
the
retrospect
his
voice
lacked
the
cheerful
clearness
he
could
have
wished
That
occurred
after
the
examination
in
comparative
anatomy
on
the
day
before
the
College
turned
out
its
students
and
was
carefully
locked
up
by
the
officials
for
the
Christmas
holidays
The
excitement
of
cramming
for
the
first
trial
of
strength
had
for
a
little
while
dominated
Hill
to
the
exclusion
of
his
other
interests
In
the
forecasts
of
the
result
in
which
everyone
indulged
he
was
surprised
to
find
that
no
one
regarded
him
as
a
possible
competitor
for
the
Harvey
Commemoration
Medal
of
which
this
and
the
two
subsequent
examinations
disposed
It
was
about
this
time
that
Wedderburn
who
so
far
had
lived
inconspicuously
on
the
uttermost
margin
of
Hills
perceptions
began
to
take
on
the
appearance
of
an
obstacle
By
a
mutual
agreement
the
nocturnal
prowlings
with
Thorpe
ceased
for
the
three
weeks
before
the
examination
and
his
landlady
pointed
out
that
she
really
could
not
supply
so
much
lamp
oil
at
the
price
He
walked
to
and
fro
from
the
College
with
little
slips
of
mnemonics
in
his
hand
lists
of
crayfish
appendages
rabbits
skullbones
and
vertebrate
nerves
for
example
and
became
a
positive
nuisance
to
foot
passengers
in
the
opposite
direction
But
by
a
natural
reaction
Poetry
and
the
girl
with
the
brown
eyes
ruled
the
Christmas
holiday
The
pending
results
of
the
examination
became
such
a
secondary
consideration
that
Hill
marvelled
at
his
fathers
excitement
Even
had
he
wished
it
there
was
no
comparative
anatomy
to
read
in
Landport
and
he
was
too
poor
to
buy
books
but
the
stock
of
poets
in
the
library
was
extensive
and
Hills
attack
was
magnificently
sustained
He
saturated
himself
with
the
fluent
numbers
of
Longfellow
and
Tennyson
and
fortified
himself
with
Shakespeare
found
a
kindred
soul
in
Pope
and
a
master
in
Shelley
and
heard
and
fled
the
siren
voices
of
Eliza
Cook
and
Mrs
Hemans
But
he
read
no
more
Browning
because
he
hoped
for
the
loan
of
other
volumes
from
Miss
Haysman
when
he
returned
to
London
He
walked
from
his
lodgings
to
the
College
with
that
volume
of
Browning
in
his
shiny
black
bag
and
his
mind
teeming
with
the
finest
general
propositions
about
poetry
Indeed
he
framed
first
this
little
speech
and
then
that
with
which
to
grace
the
return
The
morning
was
an
exceptionally
pleasant
one
for
London
there
was
a
clear
hard
frost
and
undeniable
blue
in
the
sky
a
thin
haze
softened
every
outline
and
warm
shafts
of
sunlight
struck
between
the
house
blocks
and
turned
the
sunny
side
of
the
street
to
amber
and
gold
In
the
hall
of
the
College
he
pulled
off
his
glove
and
signed
his
name
with
fingers
so
stiff
with
cold
that
the
characteristic
dash
under
the
signature
he
cultivated
became
a
quivering
line
He
imagined
Miss
Haysman
about
him
everywhere
He
turned
at
the
staircase
and
there
below
he
saw
a
crowd
struggling
at
the
foot
of
the
noticeboard
This
possibly
was
the
biology
list
He
forgot
Browning
and
Miss
Haysman
for
the
moment
and
joined
the
scrimmage
And
at
last
with
his
cheek
flattened
against
the
sleeve
of
the
man
on
the
step
above
him
he
read
the
list
CLASS
I
H
J
Somers
Wedderburn
William
Hill
and
thereafter
followed
a
second
class
that
is
outside
our
present
sympathies
It
was
characteristic
that
he
did
not
trouble
to
look
for
Thorpe
on
the
physics
list
but
backed
out
of
the
struggle
at
once
and
in
a
curious
emotional
state
between
pride
over
common
secondclass
humanity
and
acute
disappointment
at
Wedderburns
success
went
on
his
way
upstairs
At
the
top
as
he
was
hanging
up
his
coat
in
the
passage
the
zoological
demonstrator
a
young
man
from
Oxford
who
secretly
regarded
him
as
a
blatant
mugger
of
the
very
worst
type
offered
his
heartiest
congratulations
At
the
laboratory
door
Hill
stopped
for
a
second
to
get
his
breath
and
then
entered
He
looked
straight
up
the
laboratory
and
saw
all
five
girl
students
grouped
in
their
places
and
Wedderburn
the
once
retiring
Wedderburn
leaning
rather
gracefully
against
the
window
playing
with
the
blind
tassel
and
talking
apparently
to
the
five
of
them
Now
Hill
could
talk
bravely
enough
and
even
overbearingly
to
one
girl
and
he
could
have
made
a
speech
to
a
roomful
of
girls
but
this
business
of
standing
at
ease
and
appreciating
fencing
and
returning
quick
remarks
round
a
group
was
he
knew
altogether
beyond
him
Coming
up
the
staircase
his
feelings
for
Wedderburn
had
been
generous
a
certain
admiration
perhaps
a
willingness
to
shake
his
hand
conspicuously
and
heartily
as
one
who
had
fought
but
the
first
round
But
before
Christmas
Wedderburn
had
never
gone
up
to
that
end
of
the
room
to
talk
In
a
flash
Hills
mist
of
vague
excitement
condensed
abruptly
to
a
vivid
dislike
of
Wedderburn
Possibly
his
expression
changed
As
he
came
up
to
his
place
Wedderburn
nodded
carelessly
to
him
and
the
others
glanced
round
Miss
Haysman
looked
at
him
and
away
again
the
faintest
touch
of
her
eyes
I
cant
agree
with
you
Mr
Wedderburn
she
said
I
must
congratulate
you
on
your
first
class
Mr
Hill
said
the
spectacled
girl
in
green
turning
round
and
beaming
at
him
Its
nothing
said
Hill
staring
at
Wedderburn
and
Miss
Haysman
talking
together
and
eager
to
hear
what
they
talked
about
We
poor
folks
in
the
second
class
dont
think
so
said
the
girl
in
spectacles
What
was
it
Wedderburn
was
saying
Something
about
William
Morris!
Hill
did
not
answer
the
girl
in
spectacles
and
the
smile
died
out
of
his
face
He
could
not
hear
and
failed
to
see
how
he
could
cut
in
Confound
Wedderburn!
He
sat
down
opened
his
bag
hesitated
whether
to
return
the
volume
of
Browning
forthwith
in
the
sight
of
all
and
instead
drew
out
his
new
notebooks
for
the
short
course
in
elementary
botany
that
was
now
beginning
and
which
would
terminate
in
February
As
he
did
so
a
fat
heavy
man
with
a
white
face
and
pale
grey
eyes
Bindon
the
professor
of
botany
who
came
up
from
Kew
for
January
and
February
came
in
by
the
lecture
theatre
door
and
passed
rubbing
his
hands
together
and
smiling
in
silent
affability
down
the
laboratory





In
the
subsequent
six
weeks
Hill
experienced
some
very
rapid
and
curiously
complex
emotional
developments
For
the
most
part
he
had
Wedderburn
in
focusa
fact
that
Miss
Haysman
never
suspected
She
told
Hill
for
in
the
comparative
privacy
of
the
museum
she
talked
a
good
deal
to
him
of
socialism
and
Browning
and
general
propositions
that
she
had
met
Wedderburn
at
the
house
of
some
people
she
knew
and
hes
inherited
his
cleverness
for
his
father
you
know
is
the
great
eye
specialist
My
father
is
a
cobbler
said
Hill
quite
irrelevantly
and
perceived
the
want
of
dignity
even
as
he
said
it
But
the
gleam
of
jealousy
did
not
offend
her
She
conceived
herself
the
fundamental
source
of
it
He
suffered
bitterly
from
a
sense
of
Wedderburns
unfairness
and
a
realisation
of
his
own
handicap
Here
was
this
Wedderburn
had
picked
up
a
prominent
man
for
a
father
and
instead
of
his
losing
so
many
marks
on
the
score
of
that
advantage
it
was
counted
to
him
for
righteousness!
And
while
Hill
had
to
introduce
himself
and
talk
to
Miss
Haysman
clumsily
over
mangled
guineapigs
in
the
laboratory
this
Wedderburn
in
some
backstairs
way
had
access
to
her
social
altitudes
and
could
converse
in
a
polished
argot
that
Hill
understood
perhaps
but
felt
incapable
of
speaking
Not
of
course
that
he
wanted
to
Then
it
seemed
to
Hill
that
for
Wedderburn
to
come
there
day
after
day
with
cuffs
unfrayed
neatly
tailored
precisely
barbered
quietly
perfect
was
in
itself
an
illbred
sneering
sort
of
proceeding
Moreover
it
was
a
stealthy
thing
for
Wedderburn
to
behave
insignificantly
for
a
space
to
mock
modesty
to
lead
Hill
to
fancy
that
he
himself
was
beyond
dispute
the
man
of
the
year
and
then
suddenly
to
dart
in
front
of
him
and
incontinently
to
swell
up
in
this
fashion
In
addition
to
these
things
Wedderburn
displayed
an
increasing
disposition
to
join
in
any
conversational
grouping
that
included
Miss
Haysman
and
would
venture
and
indeed
seek
occasion
to
pass
opinions
derogatory
to
socialism
and
atheism
He
goaded
Hill
to
incivilities
by
neat
shallow
and
exceedingly
effective
personalities
about
the
socialist
leaders
until
Hill
hated
Bernard
Shaws
graceful
egotisms
William
Morriss
limited
editions
and
luxurious
wallpapers
and
Walter
Cranes
charmingly
absurd
ideal
working
men
about
as
much
as
he
hated
Wedderburn
The
dissertations
in
the
laboratory
that
had
been
his
glory
in
the
previous
term
became
a
danger
degenerated
into
inglorious
tussles
with
Wedderburn
and
Hill
kept
to
them
only
out
of
an
obscure
perception
that
his
honour
was
involved
In
the
debating
society
Hill
knew
quite
clearly
that
to
a
thunderous
accompaniment
of
banged
desks
he
could
have
pulverised
Wedderburn
Only
Wedderburn
never
attended
the
debating
society
to
be
pulverised
becausenauseous
affectation!he
dined
late
You
must
not
imagine
that
these
things
presented
themselves
in
quite
such
a
crude
form
to
Hills
perception
Hill
was
a
born
generaliser
Wedderburn
to
him
was
not
so
much
an
individual
obstacle
as
a
type
the
salient
angle
of
a
class
The
economic
theories
that
after
infinite
ferment
had
shaped
themselves
in
Hills
mind
became
abruptly
concrete
at
the
contact
The
world
became
full
of
easymannered
graceful
gracefullydressed
conversationally
dexterous
finally
shallow
Wedderburns
Bishops
Wedderburn
Wedderburn
MPs
Professors
Wedderburn
Wedderburn
landlords
all
with
fingerbowl
shibboleths
and
epigrammatic
cities
of
refuge
from
a
sturdy
debater
And
everyone
illclothed
or
illdressed
from
the
cobbler
to
the
cabrunner
was
a
man
and
a
brother
a
fellowsufferer
to
Hills
imagination
So
that
he
became
as
it
were
a
champion
of
the
fallen
and
oppressed
albeit
to
outward
seeming
only
a
selfassertive
illmannered
young
man
and
an
unsuccessful
champion
at
that
Again
and
again
a
skirmish
over
the
afternoon
tea
that
the
girl
students
had
inaugurated
left
Hill
with
flushed
cheeks
and
a
tattered
temper
and
the
debating
society
noticed
a
new
quality
of
sarcastic
bitterness
in
his
speeches
You
will
understand
now
how
it
was
necessary
if
only
in
the
interests
of
humanity
that
Hill
should
demolish
Wedderburn
in
the
forthcoming
examination
and
outshine
him
in
the
eyes
of
Miss
Haysman
and
you
will
perceive
too
how
Miss
Haysman
fell
into
some
common
feminine
misconceptions
The
HillWedderburn
quarrel
for
in
his
unostentatious
way
Wedderburn
reciprocated
Hills
illveiled
rivalry
became
a
tribute
to
her
indefinable
charm
she
was
the
Queen
of
Beauty
in
a
tournament
of
scalpels
and
stumpy
pencils
To
her
confidential
friends
secret
annoyance
it
even
troubled
her
conscience
for
she
was
a
good
girl
and
painfully
aware
from
Ruskin
and
contemporary
fiction
how
entirely
mens
activities
are
determined
by
womens
attitudes
And
if
Hill
never
by
any
chance
mentioned
the
topic
of
love
to
her
she
only
credited
him
with
the
finer
modesty
for
that
omission
So
the
time
came
on
for
the
second
examination
and
Hills
increasing
pallor
confirmed
the
general
rumour
that
he
was
working
hard
In
the
rated
bread
shop
near
South
Kensington
Station
you
would
see
him
breaking
his
bun
and
sipping
his
milk
with
his
eyes
intent
upon
a
paper
of
closely
written
notes
In
his
bedroom
there
were
propositions
about
buds
and
stems
round
his
lookingglass
a
diagram
to
catch
his
eye
if
soap
should
chance
to
spare
it
above
his
washing
basin
He
missed
several
meetings
of
the
debating
society
but
he
found
the
chance
encounters
with
Miss
Haysman
in
the
spacious
ways
of
the
adjacent
art
museum
or
in
the
little
museum
at
the
top
of
the
College
or
in
the
College
corridors
more
frequent
and
very
restful
In
particular
they
used
to
meet
in
a
little
gallery
full
of
wroughtiron
chests
and
gates
near
the
art
library
and
there
Hill
used
to
talk
under
the
gentle
stimulus
of
her
flattering
attention
of
Browning
and
his
personal
ambitions
A
characteristic
she
found
remarkable
in
him
was
his
freedom
from
avarice
He
contemplated
quite
calmly
the
prospect
of
living
all
his
life
on
an
income
below
a
hundred
pounds
a
year
But
he
was
determined
to
be
famous
to
make
recognisably
in
his
own
proper
person
the
world
a
better
place
to
live
in
He
took
Bradlaugh
and
John
Burns
for
his
leaders
and
models
poor
even
impecunious
great
men
But
Miss
Haysman
thought
that
such
lives
were
deficient
on
the
sthetic
side
by
which
though
she
did
not
know
it
she
meant
good
wallpaper
and
upholstery
pretty
books
tasteful
clothes
concerts
and
meals
nicely
cooked
and
respectfully
served
At
last
came
the
day
of
the
second
examination
and
the
professor
of
botany
a
fussy
conscientious
man
rearranged
all
the
tables
in
a
long
narrow
laboratory
to
prevent
copying
and
put
his
demonstrator
on
a
chair
on
a
table
where
he
felt
he
said
like
a
Hindoo
god
to
see
all
the
cheating
and
stuck
a
notice
outside
the
door
Door
closed
for
no
earthly
reason
that
any
human
being
could
discover
And
all
the
morning
from
ten
till
one
the
quill
of
Wedderburn
shrieked
defiance
at
Hills
and
the
quills
of
the
others
chased
their
leaders
in
a
tireless
pack
and
so
also
it
was
in
the
afternoon
Wedderburn
was
a
little
quieter
than
usual
and
Hills
face
was
hot
all
day
and
his
overcoat
bulged
with
textbooks
and
notebooks
against
the
last
moments
revision
And
the
next
day
in
the
morning
and
in
the
afternoon
was
the
practical
examination
when
sections
had
to
be
cut
and
slides
identified
In
the
morning
Hill
was
depressed
because
he
knew
he
had
cut
a
thick
section
and
in
the
afternoon
came
the
mysterious
slip
It
was
just
the
kind
of
thing
that
the
botanical
professor
was
always
doing
Like
the
income
tax
it
offered
a
premium
to
the
cheat
It
was
a
preparation
under
the
microscope
a
little
glass
slip
held
in
its
place
on
the
stage
of
the
instrument
by
light
steel
clips
and
the
inscription
set
forth
that
the
slip
was
not
to
be
moved
Each
student
was
to
go
in
turn
to
it
sketch
it
write
in
his
book
of
answers
what
he
considered
it
to
be
and
return
to
his
place
Now
to
move
such
a
slip
is
a
thing
one
can
do
by
a
chance
movement
of
the
finger
and
in
a
fraction
of
a
second
The
professors
reason
for
decreeing
that
the
slip
should
not
be
moved
depended
on
the
fact
that
the
object
he
wanted
identified
was
characteristic
of
a
certain
tree
stem
In
the
position
in
which
it
was
placed
it
was
a
difficult
thing
to
recognise
but
once
the
slip
was
moved
so
as
to
bring
other
parts
of
the
preparation
into
view
its
nature
was
obvious
enough
Hill
came
to
this
flushed
from
a
contest
with
staining
reagents
sat
down
on
the
little
stool
before
the
microscope
turned
the
mirror
to
get
the
best
light
and
then
out
of
sheer
habit
shifted
the
slip
At
once
he
remembered
the
prohibition
and
with
an
almost
continuous
motion
of
his
hands
moved
it
back
and
sat
paralysed
with
astonishment
at
his
action
Then
slowly
he
turned
his
head
The
professor
was
out
of
the
room
the
demonstrator
sat
aloft
on
his
impromptu
rostrum
reading
the
Q
Jour
Mi
Sci
the
rest
of
the
examinees
were
busy
and
with
their
backs
to
him
Should
he
own
up
to
the
accident
now
He
knew
quite
clearly
what
the
thing
was
It
was
a
lenticel
a
characteristic
preparation
from
the
eldertree
His
eyes
roved
over
his
intent
fellowstudents
and
Wedderburn
suddenly
glanced
over
his
shoulder
at
him
with
a
queer
expression
in
his
eyes
The
mental
excitement
that
had
kept
Hill
at
an
abnormal
pitch
of
vigour
these
two
days
gave
way
to
a
curious
nervous
tension
His
book
of
answers
was
beside
him
He
did
not
write
down
what
the
thing
was
but
with
one
eye
at
the
microscope
he
began
making
a
hasty
sketch
of
it
His
mind
was
full
of
this
grotesque
puzzle
in
ethics
that
had
suddenly
been
sprung
upon
him
Should
he
identify
it
or
should
he
leave
this
question
unanswered
In
that
case
Wedderburn
would
probably
come
out
first
in
the
second
result
How
could
he
tell
now
whether
he
might
not
have
identified
the
thing
without
shifting
it
It
was
possible
that
Wedderburn
had
failed
to
recognise
it
of
course
Suppose
Wedderburn
too
had
shifted
the
slide
He
looked
up
at
the
clock
There
were
fifteen
minutes
in
which
to
make
up
his
mind
He
gathered
up
his
book
of
answers
and
the
coloured
pencils
he
used
in
illustrating
his
replies
and
walked
back
to
his
seat
He
read
through
his
manuscript
and
then
sat
thinking
and
gnawing
his
knuckle
It
would
look
queer
now
if
he
owned
up
He
must
beat
Wedderburn
He
forgot
the
examples
of
those
starry
gentlemen
John
Burns
and
Bradlaugh
Besides
he
reflected
the
glimpse
of
the
rest
of
the
slip
he
had
had
was
after
all
quite
accidental
forced
upon
him
by
chance
a
kind
of
providential
revelation
rather
than
an
unfair
advantage
It
was
not
nearly
so
dishonest
to
avail
himself
of
that
as
it
was
of
Broome
who
believed
in
the
efficacy
of
prayer
to
pray
daily
for
a
firstclass
Five
minutes
more
said
the
demonstrator
folding
up
his
paper
and
becoming
observant
Hill
watched
the
clock
hands
until
two
minutes
remained
then
he
opened
the
book
of
answers
and
with
hot
ears
and
an
affectation
of
ease
gave
his
drawing
of
the
lenticel
its
name
When
the
second
pass
list
appeared
the
previous
positions
of
Wedderburn
and
Hill
were
reversed
and
the
spectacled
girl
in
green
who
knew
the
demonstrator
in
private
life
where
he
was
practically
human
said
that
in
the
result
of
the
two
examinations
taken
together
Hill
had
the
advantage
of
a
mark
to

out
of
a
possible

Everyone
admired
Hill
in
a
way
though
the
suspicion
of
mugging
clung
to
him
But
Hill
was
to
find
congratulations
and
Miss
Haysmans
enhanced
opinion
of
him
and
even
the
decided
decline
in
the
crest
of
Wedderburn
tainted
by
an
unhappy
memory
He
felt
a
remarkable
access
of
energy
at
first
and
the
note
of
a
democracy
marching
to
triumph
returned
to
his
debating
society
speeches
he
worked
at
his
comparative
anatomy
with
tremendous
zeal
and
effect
and
he
went
on
with
his
sthetic
education
But
through
it
all
a
vivid
little
picture
was
continually
coming
before
his
minds
eyeof
a
sneakish
person
manipulating
a
slide
No
human
being
had
witnessed
the
act
and
he
was
cocksure
that
no
higher
power
existed
to
see
it
but
for
all
that
it
worried
him
Memories
are
not
dead
things
but
alive
they
dwindle
in
disuse
but
they
harden
and
develop
in
all
sorts
of
queer
ways
if
they
are
being
continually
fretted
Curiously
enough
though
at
the
time
he
perceived
clearly
that
the
shifting
was
accidental
as
the
days
wore
on
his
memory
became
confused
about
it
until
at
last
he
was
not
surealthough
he
assured
himself
that
he
was
surewhether
the
movement
had
been
absolutely
involuntary
Then
it
is
possible
that
Hills
dietary
was
conducive
to
morbid
conscientiousness
a
breakfast
frequently
eaten
in
a
hurry
a
midday
bun
and
at
such
hours
after
five
as
chanced
to
be
convenient
such
meat
as
his
means
determined
usually
in
a
chophouse
in
a
back
street
off
the
Brompton
Road
Occasionally
he
treated
himself
to
threepenny
or
ninepenny
classics
and
they
usually
represented
a
suppression
of
potatoes
or
chops
It
is
indisputable
that
outbreaks
of
selfabasement
and
emotional
revival
have
a
distinct
relation
to
periods
of
scarcity
But
apart
from
this
influence
on
the
feelings
there
was
in
Hill
a
distinct
aversion
to
falsity
that
the
blasphemous
Landport
cobbler
had
inculcated
by
strap
and
tongue
from
his
earliest
years
Of
one
fact
about
professed
atheists
I
am
convinced
they
may
bethey
usually
arefools
void
of
subtlety
revilers
of
holy
institutions
brutal
speakers
and
mischievous
knaves
but
they
lie
with
difficulty
If
it
were
not
so
if
they
had
the
faintest
grasp
of
the
idea
of
compromise
they
would
simply
be
liberal
churchmen
And
moreover
this
memory
poisoned
his
regard
for
Miss
Haysman
For
she
now
so
evidently
preferred
him
to
Wedderburn
that
he
felt
sure
he
cared
for
her
and
began
reciprocating
her
attentions
by
timid
marks
of
personal
regard
at
one
time
he
even
bought
a
bunch
of
violets
carried
it
about
in
his
pocket
and
produced
it
with
a
stumbling
explanation
withered
and
dead
in
the
gallery
of
old
iron
It
poisoned
too
the
denunciation
of
capitalist
dishonesty
that
had
been
one
of
his
lifes
pleasures
And
lastly
it
poisoned
his
triumph
in
Wedderburn
Previously
he
had
been
Wedderburns
superior
in
his
own
eyes
and
had
raged
simply
at
a
want
of
recognition
Now
he
began
to
fret
at
the
darker
suspicion
of
positive
inferiority
He
fancied
he
found
justifications
for
his
position
in
Browning
but
they
vanished
on
analysis
At
lastmoved
curiously
enough
by
exactly
the
same
motive
forces
that
had
resulted
in
his
dishonestyhe
went
to
Professor
Bindon
and
made
a
clean
breast
of
the
whole
affair
As
Hill
was
a
paid
student
Professor
Bindon
did
not
ask
him
to
sit
down
and
he
stood
before
the
professors
desk
as
he
made
his
confession
Its
a
curious
story
said
Professor
Bindon
slowly
realising
how
the
thing
reflected
on
himself
and
then
letting
his
anger
riseA
most
remarkable
story
I
cant
understand
your
doing
it
and
I
cant
understand
this
avowal
Youre
a
type
of
studentCambridge
men
would
never
dreamI
suppose
I
ought
to
have
thoughtWhy
did
you
cheat
I
didntcheat
said
Hill
But
you
have
just
been
telling
me
you
did
I
thought
I
explained
Either
you
cheated
or
you
did
not
cheat
I
said
my
motion
was
involuntary
I
am
not
a
metaphysician
I
am
a
servant
of
scienceof
fact
You
were
told
not
to
move
the
slip
You
did
move
the
slip
If
that
is
not
cheating
If
I
was
a
cheat
said
Hill
with
the
note
of
hysterics
in
his
voice
should
I
come
here
and
tell
you
Your
repentance
of
course
does
you
credit
said
Professor
Bindon
but
it
does
not
alter
the
original
facts
No
sir
said
Hill
giving
in
in
utter
selfabasement
Even
now
you
cause
an
enormous
amount
of
trouble
The
examination
list
will
have
to
be
revised
I
suppose
so
sir
Suppose
so
Of
course
it
must
be
revised
And
I
dont
see
how
I
can
conscientiously
pass
you
Not
pass
me
said
Hill
Fail
me
Its
the
rule
in
all
examinations
Or
where
should
we
be
What
else
did
you
expect
You
dont
want
to
shirk
the
consequences
of
your
own
acts
I
thought
perhapssaid
Hill
And
then
Fail
me
I
thought
as
I
told
you
you
would
simply
deduct
the
marks
given
for
that
slip
Impossible!
said
Bindon
Besides
it
would
still
leave
you
above
Wedderburn
Deduct
only
the
marksPreposterous!
The
Departmental
Regulations
distinctly
say
But
its
my
own
admission
sir
The
Regulations
say
nothing
whatever
of
the
manner
in
which
the
matter
comes
to
light
They
simply
provide
It
will
ruin
me
If
I
fail
this
examination
they
wont
renew
my
scholarship
You
should
have
thought
of
that
before
But
sir
consider
all
my
circumstances
I
cannot
consider
anything
Professors
in
this
College
are
machines
The
Regulations
will
not
even
let
us
recommend
our
students
for
appointments
I
am
a
machine
and
you
have
worked
me
I
have
to
do
Its
very
hard
sir
Possibly
it
is
If
I
am
to
be
failed
this
examination
I
might
as
well
go
home
at
once
That
is
as
you
think
proper
Bindons
voice
softened
a
little
he
perceived
he
had
been
unjust
and
provided
he
did
not
contradict
himself
he
was
disposed
to
amelioration
As
a
private
person
he
said
I
think
this
confession
of
yours
goes
far
to
mitigate
your
offence
But
you
have
set
the
machinery
in
motion
and
now
it
must
take
its
course
II
am
really
sorry
you
gave
way
A
wave
of
emotion
prevented
Hill
from
answering
Suddenly
very
vividly
he
saw
the
heavilylined
face
of
the
old
Landport
cobbler
his
father
Good
God!
What
a
fool
I
have
been!
he
said
hotly
and
abruptly
I
hope
said
Bindon
that
it
will
be
a
lesson
to
you
But
curiously
enough
they
were
not
thinking
of
quite
the
same
indiscretion
There
was
a
pause
I
would
like
a
day
to
think
sir
and
then
I
will
let
you
knowabout
going
home
I
mean
said
Hill
moving
towards
the
door





The
next
day
Hills
place
was
vacant
The
spectacled
girl
in
green
was
as
usual
first
with
the
news
Wedderburn
and
Miss
Haysman
were
talking
of
a
performance
of
The
Meistersingers
when
she
came
up
to
them
Have
you
heard
she
said
Heard
what
There
was
cheating
in
the
examination
Cheating!
said
Wedderburn
with
his
face
suddenly
hot
How
That
slide
Moved
Never!
It
was
That
slide
that
we
werent
to
move
Nonsense!
said
Wedderburn
Why!
How
could
they
find
out
Who
do
they
say
It
was
Mr
Hill
Hill!
Mr
Hill!
Notsurely
not
the
immaculate
Hill
said
Wedderburn
recovering
I
dont
believe
it
said
Miss
Haysman
How
do
you
know
I
didnt
said
the
girl
in
spectacles
But
I
know
it
now
for
a
fact
Mr
Hill
went
and
confessed
to
Professor
Bindon
himself
By
Jove!
said
Wedderburn
Hill
of
all
people
But
I
am
always
inclined
to
distrust
these
philanthropistsonprinciple
Are
you
quite
sure
said
Miss
Haysman
with
a
catch
in
her
breath
Quite
Its
dreadful
isnt
it
But
you
know
what
can
you
expect
His
father
is
a
cobbler
Then
Miss
Haysman
astonished
the
girl
in
spectacles
I
dont
care
I
will
not
believe
it
she
said
flushing
darkly
under
her
warmtinted
skin
I
will
not
believe
it
until
he
has
told
me
so
himselfface
to
face
I
would
scarcely
believe
it
then
and
abruptly
she
turned
her
back
on
the
girl
in
spectacles
and
walked
to
her
own
place
Its
true
all
the
same
said
the
girl
in
spectacles
peering
and
smiling
at
Wedderburn
But
Wedderburn
did
not
answer
her
She
was
indeed
one
of
those
people
who
seem
destined
to
make
unanswered
remarks

Michael
S
Hart
was
the
originator
of
the
Project
Gutenbergtm
concept
of
a
library
of
electronic
works
that
could
be
freely
shared
with
anyone
For
forty
years
he
produced
and
distributed
Project
Gutenbergtm
eBooks
with
only
a
loose
network
of
volunteer
support
Project
Gutenbergtm
eBooks
are
often
created
from
several
printed
editions
all
of
which
are
confirmed
as
Public
Domain
in
the
US
unless
a
copyright
notice
is
included
Thus
we
do
not
necessarily
keep
eBooks
in
compliance
with
any
particular
paper
edition
